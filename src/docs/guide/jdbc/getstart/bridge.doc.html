<h1> 9 - JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver </h1>

<h2>9.1	 &nbsp;&nbsp; Obtaining a JDBC Driver</h2>
It is recommended that you obtain a commercial JDBC driver from a vendor
such as your database vendor or your database middleware vendor. Check the 
<a href="http://industry.java.sun.com/products/jdbc/drivers">list of 
drivers currently available</a>.
<P>The JDBC-ODBC Bridge driver is recommended only for experimental use or
when no other alternative is available.

<a name="997135"></a>
<h2>9.2	 &nbsp;&nbsp; JDBC-ODBC Bridge</h2>
<a name="996910"></a>
 If possible, use a Pure Java JDBC driver instead of the Bridge and an ODBC driver. 
This completely eliminates the client configuration required by ODBC. It also eliminates the potential that the Java VM could be corrupted by an error in the native 
code brought in by the Bridge (that is, the Bridge native library, the ODBC driver 
manager library, the ODBC driver library, and the database client library). 
<P>The JDBC-ODBC Bridge driver is recommended for use in prototyping efforts
and for cases where no other JDBC technology-based driver exists. If a
commercial, all-Java JDBC driver is available, we recommend that it be
used instead of the Bridge.

<h3>9.2.1	 &nbsp; &nbsp; What Is the JDBC-ODBC Bridge?  </h3>
<a name="997016"></a>
The JDBC-ODBC Bridge is a JDBC driver that implements JDBC operations by 
translating them into ODBC operations. To ODBC it appears as a normal application program. The Bridge implements JDBC for any database for which an ODBC 
driver is available. The Bridge is implemented as the <code>sun.jdbc.odbc</code> Java package 
and contains a native library used to access ODBC. The Bridge is a joint 
development of <a href="http://www.merant.com">Merant</a> and Java Software. 
<p>
<a name="996914"></a>
<h3>9.2.2	 &nbsp; &nbsp; ODBC Compatibility and ODBC Versions Supported</h3>
<a name="997019"></a>
<P>
On Solaris, the JDBC 2.0 bridge must be used with an ODBC 3.x driver manager. 
The bridge supports both ODBC 2.x and ODBC 3.x drivers, but has been tested
with only ODBC 3.x drivers.
<P>
On NT, the JDBC 2.0 bridge supports the ODBC 2.x and ODBC 3.x driver manager and
drivers.  The JDBC 2.0 bridge has been tested only with an ODBC 3.x driver
manager and with both ODBC 2.x and 3.x drivers.
<P>
Merant recommends that the JDBC 2.0 bridge be used with version 3.5 or
higher of Merant's DataDirect ODBC drivers.

<p>
<a name="996915"></a>
<h3>9.2.3	 &nbsp; &nbsp; The Bridge Implementation</h3>
<a name="997026"></a>
The Bridge is implemented in Java and uses Java native methods to call ODBC. 
<p>
<a name="996916"></a>
<h3>9.2.4	 &nbsp; &nbsp; Installation</h3>
<a name="997033"></a>
The Bridge is installed automatically with the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition,
as package <code>sun.jdbc.odbc</code>.  See 
your ODBC driver vendor for information on installing and configuring ODBC. No 
special configuration is required for the Bridge. See your database vendor for client 
installation and configuration information. On Solaris, some ODBC driver managers name their libs <code>libodbcinst.so</code> and <code>libodbc.so</code>. The Bridge expects these 
libraries to be named <code>libodbcinst.so.1</code> and <code>libodbc.so.1</code>, so symbolic links for 
these names must be created. 
<p>
<a name="996917"></a>
<h2>9.3	 &nbsp;&nbsp; Using the Bridge </h2>
<a name="997040"></a>
The Bridge is used by opening a JDBC connection using a URL with the <code>odbc</code> subprotocol. See below for URL examples. Before a connection can be established, the 
bridge driver class, <code>sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver</code>, must either be added to the 
<code>java.lang.System</code> property named <code>jdbc.drivers</code>, or it must be explicitly loaded 
using the Java class loader.  Explicit loading is done with the following line of code:     
<p><pre><a name="996978"></a>    Class.forName("sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver"); 
</pre><a name="996979"></a>
When loaded, the ODBC driver (like all good JDBC drivers) creates an 
instance of itself and registers this with the JDBC driver manager. 
<p>

<a name="996918"></a>
<h3>9.3.1	 &nbsp; &nbsp; Using the Bridge from an Applet</h3>
<a name="997093"></a>
JDBC used with a Pure Java JDBC driver works well with applets. The Bridge 
driver does not work well with applets. 
<p>
<a name="996919"></a>
<h3>9.3.2	 &nbsp; &nbsp; Most Browsers Do Not Support the Bridge</h3>
<a name="997100"></a>
Since the Bridge is an optional component of the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition,
it may not be provided by a 
browser. Even if it is provided, only trusted applets (those allowed to write to files) 
will be able to use the Bridge. This is required in order to preserve the security of the 
applet sandbox. Finally, even if the applet is trusted, ODBC and the DBMS client 
library must be configured on each client. 
<p>
<a name="996920"></a>
<h3>9.3.3	 &nbsp; &nbsp; Tested Configurations </h3>
<a name="997107"></a>
From Solaris, we have used the Bridge to access Oracle 8.1.5 using version
3.5 of Merant's ODBC drivers.
From NT, we have used the Bridge to access SQL Server 6.x using the latest
ODBC driver from Microsoft. 
<p>
<a name="996921"></a>
<h3>9.3.4	 &nbsp; &nbsp; ODBC Drivers Known to Work with the Bridge</h3>
<a name="997114"></a>
ODBC drivers are available for Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Microsoft SQL
Server, and Ingres.  The MERANT ODBC driver suite 
should be completely compatible with the JDBC-ODBC Bridge. 
To evaluate or purchase 
MERANT ODBC drivers, please contact MERANT DataDirect Sales at
1-800-547-4000 Option 2 or via the World Wide Web at
<code>http:\\www.merant.com</code>. 
The MS SQL Server driver has also been used successfully on NT. Many other 
ODBC drivers will likely work. 
<p>
<a name="996922"></a>
<a name="996923"></a>
<h3>9.3.5	 &nbsp; &nbsp; What Is the JDBC URL Supported by the Bridge? </h3>
<a name="997123"></a>
The Bridge driver uses the <code>odbc</code> subprotocol. URLs for this subprotocol are of the 
form: 
<p><pre><a name="997124"></a>    <code>jdbc:odbc:&lt;data-source-name&gt;[&lt;attribute-name&gt;=&lt;attribute-value&gt;]*
</code></pre><a name="997125"></a>
For example: 
<p>
<pre><a name="997006"></a>    jdbc:odbc:sybase
<a name="997007"></a>    jdbc:odbc:mydb;UID=me;PWD=secret
<a name="997013"></a>    jdbc:odbc:ora123;Cachesize=300
</pre>
<a name="996924"></a>
<h3>9.3.6	 &nbsp; &nbsp; Debugging</h3>
<a name="997077"></a>
The Bridge provides extensive tracing when <code>DriverManager</code> tracing is enabled. The 
following line of code enables tracing and sends it to standard out:    
<p><pre><a name="997072"></a>     java.sql.DriverManager.setLogStream(java.lang.System.out);
</pre>
<a name="996927"></a>
<p><a name="996877"></a>

<p>
<h2>9.4	 &nbsp;&nbsp; New JDBC 2.0 API Features Supported by the Bridge</h2>
<P>
The JDBC-ODBC Bridge driver in this release supports the following new features
in the JDBC 2.0 API:
<UL>
<LI>batch updates
<LI>updatable result sets
<LI>scrollable result sets
<LI>the new <code>BigDecimal</code> methods
<LI>the new <code>Date</code>, <code>Time</code>, and
<code>Timestamp</code> methods
</UL>
