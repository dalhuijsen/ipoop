<A NAME="INTRO">

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The RMI registry service provider allows JNDI applications to access
remote objects registered with the RMI registry.  Given the location
of a registry, the provider will create a naming context with bindings
for the objects registered there.  Such a context may be bound into
another JNDI-accessible namespace (such as LDAP, for example).
References to individual remote objects may likewise be bound into
another namespace.
<p>
A key benefit of binding registry contexts into other namespaces is
location-independent access to remote objects:  the RMI clients do not
need to know the registry's host name or port number.  RMI servers can
take advantage of this to advertise their services to potential
clients.  In addition, remote objects can be linked into the same
enterprise directory that is used to access information about people,
organizations, and network resources.
<p>
With this service provider installed, JNDI subsumes the functionality
of the <tt>java.rmi.Naming</tt> class.
<p>
<p>
This document describes the features of the RMI registry service provider.

<p>
<A NAME="PROP">
<h2>Environment Properties</h2>
<p>
The following JNDI environment properties are used by the RMI registry
service provider.
See the 
<a href="../../api/javax/naming/InitialContext.html#ENVIRONMENT">JNDI
documentation</a>
for a 
description of how properties are initialized using the environment 
properties, system properties, applet parameters, and resource files.

<p>
<a name=INITPROP><b><pre>java.naming.factory.initial</pre></b></a>
<blockquote>
    This property is used to select the registry service provider as
    the initial context.  It is not used by the provider itself.
    It specifies the class name of the initial context factory for
    the provider.
<p>
    For example:
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
env.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY,
    "com.sun.jndi.rmi.registry.RegistryContextFactory");
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    This property is used in conjunction with the
    <a href=#URLPROP><tt>java.naming.provider.url</tt> property</a>.
    This property must be set if you are using the
    registry as the initial context. The only exception is 
    if you supply only URLs to the initial context, in which case, 
    you don't need to specify this property. See 
    <a href="#RMI">RMI URLs</a> for details.

</blockquote>
<a name=URLPROP><b><pre>java.naming.provider.url</pre></b></a>
<blockquote>
    This property specifies the location of the registry when the
    registry is being used as the initial context.  It's value is an
    RMI URL with no object name component 
    (see <a href="#FORM">RMI URL Format</a> below).
<p>
    For example:
<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
env.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, "rmi://server:1099");
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    The default value of this property is "rmi:", signifying a registry
    running on port 1099 of the local host.
<p>
    This property is used in conjunction with the
    <a href=#INITPROP><tt>java.naming.factory.initial</tt> property</a>.

</blockquote>

<b><pre>java.naming.factory.state</pre></b>

<blockquote>
    A colon-separated list of the fully qualified class names
    of state factory classes used to get an object's state for storing
    given the object itself. You can use this mechanism to transform
    an object into forms that can be stored into the registry.
    The RMI registry service provider supports storing <tt>java.rmi.Remote</tt>,
    <tt>javax.naming.Reference</tt>, and <tt>javax.naming.Referenceable</tt> objects.
    See 
<a href="../../api/javax/naming/spi/NamingManager.html#getStateToBind(java.lang.Object, javax.naming.Name, javax.naming.Context, java.util.Hashtable)">
<tt>javax.naming.spi.NamingManager.getStateToBind()</tt></a> for details.
</blockquote>

<b><pre>java.naming.factory.object</pre></b>

<blockquote>

    A colon-separated list of the fully qualified class names
    of object factory classes for transforming objects read from the registry.
    You can use this mechanism to transform an object into forms expected
    by the application. See
<a href="../../api/javax/naming/spi/NamingManager.html#getObjectInstance(java.lang.Object, javax.naming.Name, javax.naming.Context, java.util.Hashtable)">
<tt>javax.naming.spi.NamingManager.getObjectInstance()</tt></a> for details.
</blockquote>

<b><pre>java.naming.rmi.security.manager</pre></b>
<blockquote>
    This property, when set to any value, indicates that the provider
    should attempt to install the <tt>RMISecurityManager</tt>.  See the
    <a href="#SEC">Security Considerations</a> section below.
</blockquote>

<p>
<A NAME="NAME">
<h2>Names</h2>
<p>

The RMI registry supports a flat namespace.  Since there is no
hierarchy, every name is atomic.  Each name may be composed of any
characters, and case is significant.
<p>
Names are passed as arguments to the methods of a registry context,
and are returned as the results of those methods, either as 
<tt><a href="../../api/javax/naming/Name.html">Name</a></tt>
objects or as strings.  When a <tt>Name</tt> object is used, it should have a
single component whose value is the atomic name that will be passed on
to the registry.  When a string is used as a name, it is interpreted
as the string representation of a composite name.  So if <tt>ctx</tt> is a
registry context, for example, then the following two unbind
operations are equivalent:
<blockquote><pre>
String name = ...
ctx.unbind(name);
ctx.unbind(new CompositeName(name));
</pre></blockquote>

Care must be taken with names containing any of the four
meta-characters that are treated specially during the parsing of
composite names:  '/', '\\', '"', and '\''.  These characters must
be properly escaped or quoted.  The atomic name <em>X/Y</em>, for example,
may be represented as the composite name <em>X\/Y</em> so as not to be
mistaken for a two-component name with <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> as its components.
See <a href="../../api/javax/naming/CompositeName.html"><tt>CompositeName</tt></a> for more information.

<p>
<A NAME="RMI">
<h2>RMI URLs</h2>
<p>
JNDI provides support for resolving URLs that name objects.  The
registry service provider allows RMI URLs to be used as names in this
manner.  This provides a generalization of the <tt>java.rmi.Naming</tt>
functionality, only using the more general JNDI interface.
<p>
The class <tt>com.sun.jndi.url.rmi.rmiURLContextFactory</tt> implements
a URL context factory for RMI URLs.  This allows an RMI URL to be passed
as a name to the default JNDI initial context.
<hr>
<p>
<A NAME="FORM">
<h2>RMI URL Format</h2>
<p>
The format of an RMI URL is one of the following:
<pre>
   rmi://[host][:port][/[object]]

   rmi:[/][object]
</pre>
If the object name is absent, then the URL names the registry at the
given host and port.  Otherwise, it names the remote object registered
at that registry under the name provided.
<p>
If the host is omitted, the local host is assumed.  If the port
is omitted, the default registry port 1099 is assumed.
<hr>
<p>
<A NAME="MAP">
<h2>API Mapping</h2>
<p>

The registry service provider implements the <tt>java.naming.Context</tt> and 
<tt>java.naming.Referenceable</tt>
interfaces.  <tt>Context</tt> and <tt>Referenceable</tt> methods are
mapped onto registry operations as described below.

<b><pre>
lookup()
lookupLink()
</pre></b>
<blockquote>
    The <tt>java.rmi.Registry.lookup()</tt> method is called.  If the returned
    object is a wrapper around a <tt>javax.naming.Reference</tt>, 
    the referenced object is
    created using <tt>javax.naming.spi.NamingManager.getObjectInstance()</tt>.  
    JNDI links
    are not currently supported.
</blockquote>

<b><pre>bind()</pre></b>
<blockquote>
    The <tt>java.rmi.Registry.bind()</tt> method is called.  State factories are
    first consulted through <tt>javax.naming.spi.NamingManager.getStateToBind()</tt>.  The
    object being bound must be of type <tt>java.rmi.Remote</tt>,
    <tt>javax.naming.Reference</tt>, or <tt>javax.naming.Referenceable</tt>.  
    If the object is a
    <tt>javax.naming.Reference</tt> or <tt>javax.naming.Referenceable</tt>, 
    its reference is wrapped in a <tt>Remote</tt> wrapper and then bound 
    (see <a href="#BIND">Binding Objects into the Registry</a> below).
</blockquote>


<b><pre>rebind()</pre></b>
<blockquote>
    The <tt>java.rmi.Registry.rebind()</tt> method is called.  Objects are
    otherwise treated as for the JNDI <tt>bind()</tt> operation.
</blockquote>

<b><pre>unbind()</pre></b>
<blockquote>
    The <tt>java.rmi.Registry.unbind()</tt> method is called.
</blockquote>

<b><pre>rename()</pre></b>
<blockquote>
    This method is implemented as a sequence of JNDI operations:
    <tt>lookup()</tt>, <tt>bind()</tt>, <tt>unbind()</tt>.  The sequence
    is not performed atomically.
</blockquote>

<b><pre>list()</pre></b>
<blockquote>
    The <tt>java.rmi.Registry.list()</tt> method is called.  As this provides no
    information about the types of the bound objects, each
    <tt>javax.naming.NameClassPair</tt> returned has the generic
    <tt>java.lang.Object</tt> as its class name.
</blockquote>

<b><pre>listBindings()</pre></b>
<blockquote>
    The <tt>java.rmi.Registry.list()</tt> method is called.  As each 
    <tt>javax.naming.Binding</tt> is read from the resulting enumeration,
    <tt>java.rmi.Registry.lookup()</tt> is called and passed through
    <tt>javax.naming.spi.NamingManager.getObjectInstance()</tt>. 
</blockquote>

<b><pre>createSubcontext()
destroySubcontext()</pre></b>
<blockquote>
    These operations are not supported.
</blockquote>

<b><pre>getNameParser()</pre></b>
<blockquote>
    Returns a name parser for case-sensitive atomic names.
</blockquote>

<b><pre>getNameInNamespace()</pre></b>
<blockquote>
    Returns the empty string (the name of the registry).
</blockquote>

<b><pre>composeName()</pre></b>
<blockquote>
    Returns the composition of the two names.
</blockquote>

<b><pre>addToEnvironment()</pre></b>
<blockquote>
    The specified property is added to the context's environment.
    If the <tt>java.naming.rmi.security.manager</tt> property is added,
    the provider will attempt to install the default RMI security manager
    (see <a href="#SEC">Security Considerations</a>). Other properties may be
    added or changed in the environment, but have no additional effect on
    the context.
</blockquote>

<b><pre>removeFromEnvironment()</pre></b>
<blockquote>
    The specified property is removed from the context's environment.
    The context is otherwise unaffected.
</blockquote>

<b><pre>close()</pre></b>
<blockquote>
    Clears internal state used by the provider, but otherwise has
    no immediate effect.
</blockquote>

<b><pre>getReference()</pre></b>
<blockquote>
    If this context was constructed from a reference, a clone of
    that reference is returned.  Otherwise a new reference for the
    context is returned, providing that the host name can be
    determined and is not "localhost" 
    (see <a href="#BIND">Binding Registry Contexts and Remote Objects</a>
    below).
</blockquote>

<p>
<A NAME="BIND">
<h2>Bindings</h2>
<p>

<b>Binding Objects into the Registry</b>
<p>
An object may be bound into a registry context if it implements the
<tt>java.rmi.Remote</tt> interface.  An object may also be bound if it is
a JNDI Reference object, or if it implements the <tt>Referenceable</tt>
interface (in which case the corresponding reference will be bound in
place of the object itself).
<p>

<b>Binding Registry Contexts and Remote Objects</b>
<p>
Each RMI registry context implements the <tt>Referenceable</tt> interface.
It may therefore be bound into any JNDI-accessible namespace that can
store <tt>Referenceable</tt> objects.  A reference to an individual remote
object that is registered with a registry may also be constructed,
allowing that object to be bound into another namespace.
<p>
The class <tt>com.sun.jndi.rmi.registry.RegistryContextFactory</tt> 
implements the object factory that converts registry references into the
corresponding registry contexts or remote objects.
<p>
For a registry context to be constructed, the registry's URL must be
determined.  This URL may come from the
<tt>java.naming.provider.url</tt> property, or may be passed as a name
to the initial context, or may be embedded in a registry reference.  If
the URL contains no host name or uses the host name "localhost", then the
registry context's <tt>getReference()</tt> method is unable to return a
reference for the context.  Such a registry context, therefore, cannot be
bound into another namespace.
<p>

<b>Registry Reference Format</b>
<p>
A JNDI reference for an RMI registry contains
a list of string addresses (class <tt>StringRefAddr</tt>), each
tagged with the type "URL".  Each address contains an RMI URL locating
either a registry, or a remote object registered with a registry 
(see <a href="#FORM">RMI URL Format</a> above).
<p>
When multiple URLs appear within a single reference, each
represents an alternative address for the same logical resource.  The
order of the addresses is not significant.  Addresses not of class
<tt>StringRefAddr</tt>, or not of address type "URL", are ignored.
<hr>
<p>

<A NAME="USAGE">
<h2>Usage Examples</h2>
<p>

<b>Example 1</b>
<p>
To create an initial context that accesses a registry, set the
properties <tt>java.naming.factory.initial</tt> and
<tt>java.naming.provider.url</tt> as described in 
<a href="#PROP">Environment Properties</a> above.  Then the names stored
in the registry, for example, may be listed as follows:
<blockquote>
<pre>
Context ictx = new InitialContext(env);
NamingEnumeration enum = ictx.list("");
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>Example 2</b>
<p>
Instead of using the properties as above, you may pass an RMI URL
as a name to resolve in the default initial context:
<blockquote>
<pre>
Context registryCtx = (Context)ictx.lookup("rmi://host");
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>Example 3</b>
<p>
A registry context may be bound into another JNDI-accessible
namespace.  To bind <tt>registryCtx</tt> (from the preceding example) into an
LDAP directory, for example:
<blockquote>
<pre>
Context ldapCtx = (Context)ictx.lookup("ldap://server/o=sun,c=us");
ldapCtx.bind("cn=rmi", registryCtx);
</pre>
</blockquote>

If the names <em>R1</em> and <em>R2</em> are bound in this registry, then a JNDI
client browsing the LDAP namespace will see <em>R1</em> and <em>R2</em> beneath the
<em>cn=rmi</em> entry.
<p>

<b>Example 4</b>
<p>
A remote object that is registered with an RMI registry may be
bound into another JNDI-accessible namespace by constructing a
reference for that object.  If the variable <tt>obj</tt> holds the object
named <em>R1</em> from the preceding examples, it may be bound into an LDAP
directory as follows:
<blockquote>
<pre>
RefAddr addr = new StringRefAddr("URL", "rmi://host/R1");
Reference ref = new Reference(obj.getClass().getName(), addr);
ldapCtx.bind("cn=R1", ref);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>

<A NAME="SEC">
<h2>Security Considerations</h2>

<h4>Security Manager</h4>
<p>
The usual security considerations of RMI apply.  For RMI to
dynamically load classes from a remote server, a security manager must
first be installed.  This can be done in the same way as it would for
any other RMI application.  See the 
<a href="../rmi/spec/rmiTOC.html">
Java<sup>TM</sup> Remote Method Invocation Specification</a>.  Or, if the
environment property <tt>java.naming.rmi.security.manager</tt> is passed
to the provider, then the provider will attempt to install the
<tt>RMISecurityManager</tt> itself.

<h4>Permissions</h4>
<p>
The application using JNDI and the RMI registry provider must be
granted the following permissions:
<p>
<pre>permission java.net.SocketPermission "host[:port]", "connect";</pre>
<blockquote>
	For each host/port identified in the <tt>java.naming.provider.url</tt>
        property and in URL string names supplied to context methods.
</blockquote>
<p>
<pre>permission java.net.SocketPermission "host[:port]", "connect,accept";
</pre>
<blockquote>
	For each host/port identified in the URL strings in 
        <tt>javax.naming.Reference</tt>s.
</blockquote>
<p>
<pre>permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "setSecurityManager";</pre>
<blockquote>
	If using the <tt>java.naming.rmi.security.manager</tt> environment
        property, which asks the RMI registry provider to install the
        <tt>RMISecurityManager</tt>.
