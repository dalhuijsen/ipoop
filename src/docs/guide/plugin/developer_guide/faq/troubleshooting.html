<h2><b><font size=+1><a name="general"></a></font></b>General Troubleshooting 
  Issues</h2>
<p><b>Q. Why do I get a <code>javax.net.ssl.SSLException</code> (or hang or disconnect) 
  when accessing an applet from an HTTPS site.</b></p>
<p> A. In some SSL/TLS servers you will encounter this problem if a client message 
  is received in a format it doesn't understand or with a protocol version number 
  that it doesn't support. The problem is on the server side. There may be several 
  aspects of the SSL/TLS protocol that are not implemented correctly. If the server 
  only speaks SSLv3, when a client sends a TLSv1 (aka SSLv3.1) hello the server 
  is supposed to respond with a SSLv3 server hello (aka SSLv3.0). But the server 
  is not doing so; hence, you get the exception (<code>SSLException</code>).</p>
<p> In Java Plug-in 1.3.x the browser's implementation of SSL was used. Netscape 
  4.x and Internet Explorer provide only an SSLv3.0 implementation. The problem 
  will not be seen because in this version of Plug-in only SSLv3.0 is used.</p>
<p> In Java Plug-in 1.4.0 the JSSE implementation of TLS/SSL was used. By default, 
  JSSE enables the TLSv1, SSLv3, and SSLv2Hello protocols. In this version of 
  Plug-in TLSv1 will be used, and this problem may be seen on servers with incorrect 
  protocol implementations. </p>
<p> Below are some ways to work around this problem. Turn off the TLSv1 protocol 
  and use only SSLv3.</p>
<p> 1. In the Java Plug-in Control Panel (<b>Advanced</b> tab) specify:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>-Dhttps.protocols=&quot;SSLv3,SSLv2Hello&quot;</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p> 2. Set the system property: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>System.setProperty(&quot;https.protocols&quot;, &quot;SSLv3&quot;);</code> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p> 3. If you have access to the socket, you can do this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>socket.setEnabledProtocols(&quot;SSLv3&quot;);</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p> In Java Plug-in 1.4.1 the SSLv3 and SSLv2Hello protocols are used by default. 
  Because most browsers use SSLv3 by default and most web servers support it&#151;and 
  to avoid seeing the above problem&#151;the change was made to this version of 
  the Plug-in. Users that need to use TLSv1 should set the <code>https.protocols</code> 
  settings.</p>
<p><b>Q: Is there a way, other than restarting the browser, to force the JVM to 
  check the server for modified JAR files for a page with an applet?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Modified jar files will be downloaded from the server when a page 
  with an applet is refreshed or revisited if you first do this: type &quot;x&quot; 
  in the Java Console to clear the Classloader cache.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Q: When trying to play a game on <code>http://games.yahoo.com</code> I get 
  a <code>ControlAccessException</code>. What is the problem and is there a workaround?</b>
<p>A: The problem is that the game applet needs permission to connect to one or 
  more servers, and it is being denied permission for security reasons. The workaround 
  is this: Add the following to your <code>java.policy</code> file:
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>grant codeBase &quot;http://download.yahoo.com/games/clients/&quot; 
    {<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;permission java.net.SocketPermission &quot;*&quot;,&quot;connect&quot;;};</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>java.policy</code> is located in <code>&lt;JRE installation directory&gt;/Java/j2re1.4.0/lib/security/</code>.</p>
<p><b>Q: How do I get Nescape to find my plugin when I've downloaded and installed 
  the J2SE, which includes Java Plug-in?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>Set the <tt>NPX_PLUGIN_PATH</tt> envirronement variable to the location 
  of the Java Plug-in (the directory in which the <tt>javaplugin.so</tt> file 
  is located): 
<blockquote> 
  <p><tt>NPX_PLUGIN_PATH=$JAVAHOME/jre/plugin/sparc</tt><code>/ns4</code> for 
    Netscape 4<br>
    <tt>NPX_PLUGIN_PATH=$JAVAHOME/jre/plugin/sparc</tt><code>/ns6</code> for Netscape 
    6 </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Q: I can't get Java Plug-in software to install in an intranet environment 
  when I place it on our Netscape Enterprise 3.0 SuiteSpot web server. Why not?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>We have reports that the Netscape Enterprise 3.0 SuiteSpot Webserver 
  is unable, at least in some circumstances, to serve up .exe files. One apparent 
  workaround has been to configure the HTML so that the Java Plug-in product is 
  installed by a Visigenic Orb Gatekeeper, which also functions as a web server. 
<p><b>Q: I'm having trouble debugging with Java Plug-in Software. Do you have 
  any tips?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>In some circumstances, Java Plug-in Software will use a different 
  debug connection address than expected. This occurs when Java Plug-in Software 
  is loaded into the <code>Explorer.exe</code> process running in one of the following 
  configurations: 
<ul>
  <li>Windows 95/NT running Active Desktop with IE4 or later 
  <li>Windows 98/ME/2000
</ul>
<p> Java Plug-in Software is loaded into the <code>Explorer.exe</code> process 
  when an HTML page containing the <tt>OBJECT</tt> tag is viewed in the following 
  ways: 
<ul>
  <li>via preview in an Explorer folder, if the desktop settings allow web content 
    to be viewed in folders (in other words, if the View->As Web Page menu option 
    is checked) 
  <li>via Internet Explorer, if the Microsoft Internet settings for "Launch browser 
    windows in a separate process" or "Browse in a new process" are not set 
  <li>via a web page shown on the Active Desktop 
</ul>
<p> This can cause problems when debugging Java applets, since no two processes 
  should use the same debug connection address. (See <a href="../debugger.html#how">How 
  to Debug Applets in Java Plug-in</a> in <a href="../debugger.html">Debugging 
  Support</a> regarding setting of the connection address.). If the <code>Explorer.exe</code> 
  process has already claimed the debug connection address, and the <code>Netscape.exe</code> 
  or <code>Iexplorer.exe</code> tries to use it, debugging problems may result. 
<p> Java Plug-in Software avoids this complication when loaded into the <code>Explorer.exe</code> 
  process by prepending the debug connection address specified in the Control 
  Panel with the string <code>Explorer</code>. 
<p> For example, if the default connection address set at the time of Java Plug-in 
  Software installation is <code>2502</code>, when running under <code>Explorer.exe</code> 
  it is actually set to <code>Explorer:2502</code>. 
<p> When running JDB from the Java 2 SDK you should specify 
<blockquote>
  <p> <code>jdb -attach Explorer:2502</code> </p>
</blockquote>
<p> to attach to the JVM loaded into the <code>Explorer.exe</code> process. 
<p><b>Q: My applet is no longer scriptable in Internet Explorer with Java Plug-in. 
  Why?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>With Java Plug-in Software 1.3 a <tt> scriptable</tt> tag must be 
  included and given a value of "true" in order for an applet to be scriptable. 
  See the <a href="../using_tags.html">Using <code>OBJECT</code>, <code>EMBED</code> 
  and <code>APPLET</code> Tags in Java Plug-in</a> for more information. 
<p><b>Q: Why am I having problems using some standard extensions/optional packages?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>Only extensions installed in the <code>&lt;jre&gt;\lib\ext</code> 
  directory will be added to the classpath. Extensions installed in directories 
  pointed to by the <code>java.ext.dirs</code> system property will not be added. 
<p><b>Q: Java Plug-in used to work with my Navigator 4.0.x browser. But when I 
  upgraded to Navigator 4.5 and re-installed Java Plug-in, it does not work with 
  Navigator 4.5. Why?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>It has been reported that Navigator 4.5 may not install the user 
  profile properly during installation. As a result, Java Plug-in Software may 
  not read the correct user profile setting. To make sure the user profile setting 
  is correct, check the following: 
<ul>
  <li><code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Netscape\Netscape Navigator\Users\CurrentUser 
    </code>
  <li><code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Netscape\Netscape Navigator\Users\&lt;UserName&gt;\DirRoot 
    </code>
</ul>
Make sure that these two registry keys exist and <code>&lt;DirRoot&gt;</code> 
points to an existing user profile. If any of the registry keys are missing or 
incomplete, use the User Profile Manager tool to recreate your profile. 
<p><b>Q: We are trying to use Java 3D with Java Plug-in but it doesn't work at 
  all. Why?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>Java 3D comes with various packages. Installing it incorrectly may 
  inadvertently disable Java Plug-in or cause it to fail. Follow these general 
  instructions for using Java 3D and Java Plug-in Software: 
<ol>
  <li>Install Java Plug-in first. 
  <li>Install Java 3D in a new directory. Do not install it over the existing 
    Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition/JRE. See <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/java3d-install.html">this 
    page</a> for installation instructions.
  <li>Install a version of the SDK/JRE that is appropriate for Java 3D if one 
    is not already installed on your computer.
  <li>In the Java Plug-in Control Panel, select the appropriate version of the 
    SDK/JRE..
</ol>
The Java 3D demos should now run within Java Plug-in. 
<p><b>Q: Some web/proxy servers require users to login for authentication. When 
  I used the browser to access this server with Java Plug-in, two login dialog 
  boxes appeared. Why?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>Normally Java Plug-in will download the applets using its own connection. 
  If the web/proxy server requires login, the browser will first encounter the 
  request and bring up a login dialog box. After the HTML page is downloaded, 
  Java Plug-in will try to download the class or jar files for the applet. However, 
  since Java Plug-in has no access to the login information that the browser previously 
  obtained, it will bring up its own login dialog box. 
<p><b>Q: When I tried to deploy Java Plug-in in the intranet and put the binaries 
  on the internal web server, IE doesn't download and install Java Plug-in Software 
  when it encounters the converted page. What's going on?&nbsp;</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>You may want to check that the <tt>CODEBASE</tt> in the <tt>OBJECT</tt> 
  tag actually has the correct URL for Java Plug-in. Also, turning off execute 
  privileges on the directory in which you put the Java Plug-in Software executable 
  may help. 
<p><b>Q: I am experiencing problems getting an applet to render using Java Plug-in 
  Software. What is the cause of this? </b> 
<p><b>A: </b>While this may be due to a variety of circumstances unique to your 
  operating environment, a frequent cause of this problem is a security exception. 
<ul>
  <p><b>Problem: </b> Your network does not support DNS (Domain Name Service). 
    In order to perform certain security checks, the applet <code>SecurityManager</code> 
    needs to be able to find the IP address from which your applet was downloaded. 
    If DNS is not available, these security checks may fail. 
  <p><b>Workaround: </b> When visiting the target web page, specify an IP address 
    rather than a hostname in the URL. For example, use &quot;http://123.45.35.128/fred.html". 
</ul>
<p>&nbsp; 
<b>Q: I changed my browser setting while Java Plug-in Software was running, but 
it still uses the old settings after the change. Why?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>The browser settings are read in by Java Plug-in when it is started. 
  These settings are valid throughout the lifetime of the browser session. To 
  make Java Plug-in read in the new settings, restart your browser. If you are 
  running Active Desktop with Java Plug-in, you need to restart the computer. 
<p><b>Q: When I loaded my applet, it said "noninit" or "applet not initialized" 
  in the browser's status bar. How can I identify the cause of the problem?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>Follow these steps: 
<ol>
  <li> Look at the error message in the Java Console.</li>
  <li> If you are accessing the applet through the network, make sure the proxy 
    info shown in the Java Console is correct.</li>
  <li> Make sure all the class/JAR files are in the right directory.</li>
  <li> Make sure the converted HTML page is correct.</li>
  <li> Try the unconverted page with AppletViewer on the same machine. If it works, 
    check 3, 4, and 5 again. </li>
</ol>
<p><b>Q: When I try to use the <code>AppletClassLoader</code> with Java Plug-in 
  Software, it crashes with a null pointer exception in IE4 but works fine in 
  Netscape. Why does this happen? Is there a way to make it work correctly in 
  IE4?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>Java Plug-in Software in IE4 tries to load &lt;<i>YourAppletName</i>&gt;<code>BeanInfo.class</code> 
  even if your applet is not a bean. There is a bug in Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition 
  v 1.3 in the <code>AppletClassLoader</code> that occurs when trying to load 
  nonexistent classes. To prevent this problem, create an empty &lt;<i>YourAppletName</i>&gt;BeanInfo.class. 
<p><b>Q: Why does Java Plug-in Software sometimes crash Internet Explorer but 
  not Netscape Navigator?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>In certain circumstances, bad HTML will cause the browser to crash. 
  One example is the absence of an &lt;/XMP> tag. Please make sure your HTML is 
  correct. 
<p> Another possibility is that the plug-in was disabled using the Control Panel 
  before you accessed a Plug-in-enabled page. Please check your settings to make 
  sure the Plug-in is enabled. 
<p><b>Q: My applet used to create a top-level frame that would remain visible 
  through page switches. When I upgraded to Java Plug-in this no longer occurs. 
  Why?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>In Java Plug-in Software, applets are stopped and destroyed during 
  page switches. All the visible components should be destroyed as well. There 
  has been an enhancement in Java 2 SDK that makes sure that all of the resources 
  of the applet are properly released, including the top-level frame.

<h2><b><font size=+1><a name="installation"></a></font></b>Troubleshooting Installation 
  Issues </h2>
<p><b>Q: I am trying to install the Java Plug-in on a network drive. However, 
  it doesn't install. Why?&nbsp;</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>If your network drive is protected or read-only, you will not be 
  able to install the Java Plug-in. Contact your system administrator for more 
  details. 
<p><b>Q: I am trying to install Java Plug-in. However, whenever the install program 
  tries to install the Java Plug-in for Netscape Navigator, it displays an error. 
  My Navigator is on a network drive. Is there a way to fix this?&nbsp;</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>If your Navigator is installed on a network drive, you may not have 
  permission to install the plugin DLL on the Navigator Plugins directory. Contact 
  your system administrator for more details. 
<p><b>Q: I'm having trouble installing the Java Plug-in on my Microsoft Windows 
  machine. I see the error: "An application error has occurred and an application 
  error log is being generated. Exception: access violation ..." What might be 
  the problem?&nbsp;</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>The Microsoft Window installation (using Installshield's installer) 
  may not work if you have Quarterdeck's Cleansweep product running in the background. 
<p><b>Q: When I reboot after I uninstalling Java Plug-in software, I get a dialog 
  box warning that a </b><code><b>.cpl</b></code><b> file has been removed. What 
  is this?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>If the Java Plug-in Control Panel is open while you are uninstalling 
  the plug-in, <tt>plugincpl.cpl</tt> will not be removed as it is locked when 
  the Control Panel folder is open. 
<p><b>Q: When I uninstall Java Plug-in, the Microsoft Window Plugin for Netscape 
  seems to stay on the machine. How can I remove that?&nbsp; </b> 
<p><b>A: </b>Delete the <tt>NPJPI&lt;<i>modified version number</i>&gt;.dll</tt> 
  from the Netscape <code>Plugins</code> directory. For example, for Java Plug-in 
  1.4.0, delete <code>NPJPI140.dll</code> from the <code>Plugins</code> directory.
<h2><b><font size=+1><a name="security"></a></font></b>Troubleshooting Security 
  Issues </h2>
<p><b>Q: I have some security-related issues in my applet. How do I debug it?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>You can enable the <code>java.security.debug</code> property to enable 
  trace messages from the security system. Please see <a href="../debugger.html#jsdp">java.security.debug 
  Property</a> in the chapter called Debugging Support for more information. 
<p><b>Q: When downloading applets from the Internet, an <code>AccessControlExcpetion</code> 
  is thrown. However, when the applet is located on the intranet, it works. Why?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>To prevent DNS spoofing, a security check in Java Plug-in requires 
  the host name to be resolved into an IP address before any connection is made 
  from the applet. However, the side-effect of this security check is to require 
  the intranet DNS server to be able to resolve any external host name from the 
  Internet. For some customers, this is not the way their DNS servers are setup 
  within the enterprise, and it causes Java Plug-in to fail. To resolve this issue, 
  there are several options: 
<ol>
  <li> Modify the HTML page of the applet, so the codebase and document base of 
    the applet contains IP addresses instead of host names. This will avoid Java 
    Plug-in performing a DNS lookup for the host name. 
  <li> Set <tt>trustProxy</tt> to true in Java Plug-in. By setting this property, 
    Java Plug-in will trust the proxy to perform a proper DNS lookup and return 
    information to Java Plug-in from trusted hosts. For intranet customers whose 
    proxy servers are setup internally and can be trusted, this property may be 
    used. This property may be specified as <code>-DtrustProxy=true</code> in 
    the Java Plug-in Control Panel. 
    <p> Note that this property should be set by administrator, as setting this 
      property improperly with an untrusted proxy server may expose the client 
      machines to DNS spoofing. This property is similar to the <code>security.lower_java_network_security_by_trusting_proxies</code> 
      property supported by Netscape Navigator's JVM. 
  </ol>
<p><b>Q: I keep getting a <code>ClassFormatError </code>exception when my webpage 
  is loaded with HTTPS in Netscape Navigator. Why?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>This is caused by an applet specifying a nonexistent <code>.jar</code> 
  or <code>.class</code> file in the <tt>EMBED</tt> tag. Due to limitation of 
  what information can be returned via HTTPS in Navigator, the web server's "File 
  Not Found" HTML page is returned instead of the appropriate status. This HTML 
  page is treated as a <code>.class</code> file and that causes the exception. 
<p><b>Q: I tried to run an RSA signed applet with Java Plug-in, but it is being 
  treated as an untrusted applet. What is the problem?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>There are several possibilities: 
<ul>
  <li>Your applet is not signed properly. Use the Netscape's <code>signtool</code> 
    or Sun's <code>jarsigner</code> to verify it. 
  <li>Your RSA certificate and its certificate chain may have expired. 
</ul>
Please see our <a href="../rsa_signing.html">How to Sign Applets Using RSA-Signed 
Certificates</a> for details. 
<p><b>Q: Why do I get a yellow banner across my applet frame when using Java Plug-in? 
  </b> 
<p><b>A: </b>When an applet creates a free-standing Frame, Java Plug-in adds a 
  yellow warning banner so users will know they are dealing with an untrusted 
  applet window. 
<p><b>Q: Can I disable the yellow warning banner on frames?&nbsp; </b> 
<p><b>A: </b>The yellow warning banner is an important security feature. It cannot 
  be disabled by untrusted applets. 
<p>If you use a signed applet, where the signing key is trusted by the end user, 
  then the warning banner will not be shown. 
<p><b>Q: How do I prevent the warning banner from covering my GUI state?&nbsp; 
  </b>
