<H2>Subjects, Principals, Authentication, and Credentials</H2>

<blockquote>

<p> To authorize access to resources, applications first need to
authenticate the source of the request.  The JAAS framework defines the term
<b><i>subject</i></b> to represent the source of a request.
A subject may be any entity, such as a person or service.
A subject is represented by the 
<a href="../../../../api/javax/security/auth/Subject.html">
<code>javax.security.auth.Subject</code></a> class.

<p><b><i>Authentication</i></b> represents
the process by which the identity of a subject is verified,
and must be performed in a secure fashion; otherwise a perpetrator may
impersonate others to gain access to a system. Authentication
typically involves the subject demonstrating some form of evidence to
prove its identity.  Such evidence may be information only the subject
would likely know or have (such as a password or fingerprint), or it may be
information only the subject could produce (such as signed data using a
private key).

<p>Once authenticated, a Subject is populated with associated identities, or
<b><i>Principals</i></b> (of type 
<a href="../../../../api/java/security/Principal.html">
<code>java.security.Principal</code></a>).  
A Subject may have many Principals.
For example, a person may have a name Principal
("John Doe") and an SSN Principal ("123-45-6789"),
which distinguish it from other Subjects.

<p> In addition to associated Principals, a Subject may own security-related 
attributes, which are referred to as <b><i>credentials</i></b>.
A credential may contain information used to authenticate the subject to 
new services.  Such credentials include passwords, Kerberos tickets,
and public key certificates.
Credentials might also contain data that simply enables
the subject to perform certain activities.  Cryptographic keys, for
example, represent credentials that enable the subject to sign or
encrypt data. 
Public and private credential classes are not part of the core JAAS class
library.  Any class, therefore, can represent a credential.
