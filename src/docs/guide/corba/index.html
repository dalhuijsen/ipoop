<H1>CORBA Technology and the Java<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP>
2 Platform, Standard Edition</H1> </P>


<P>The Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition, v1.4, provides an Object Request Broker (ORB) and two 
CORBA programming 
models that can utilize the Java CORBA ORB and Internet InterORB Protocol 
(IIOP).  This topic discusses these options for creating and 
distributing CORBA technology.

<P>CORBA technology is an integral part of the Java 2 platform.  It 
consists of an <A HREF="#orb">Object Request Broker (ORB)</A>, APIs for the the <A HREF="#rmi">RMI 
programming model</A>, and APIs for the the <A HREF="#idl">IDL programming model</A>. 
 </P> 

<P>For more information on which specifications are implemented in this release of the Java platform, see the <a href="../../api/org/omg/CORBA/doc-files/compliance.html">compliance</a> 
document.


<H2>How does J2SE leverage CORBA</H2>

<P><a href="http://www.corba.org">Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA)</a> technology is the
open standard for heterogeneous computing.  CORBA complements the
Java<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> platform by providing a
distributed object framework, services to support that framework, and
interoperability with other languages.  The Java platform complements 
CORBA
by providing "Write Once, Run Anywhere<SUP><FONT 
SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP>"
portability, a highly productive implementation environment, and a very
robust platform.  By combining the Java platform with CORBA and other 
key
enterprise technologies, the Java 2 Platform is the ultimate platform 
for
distributed technology solutions.  </P> 

<P> CORBA standards provide the
proven, interoperable infrastructure to the Java platform.  IIOP 
(Internet
Inter-ORB Protocol) manages the communication between the object 
components
that power the system.  The Java platform provides a portable object
infrastructure that works on every major operating system.  CORBA 
provides
the network transparency, Java provides the implementation 
transparency.



<A NAME="orb"></A>
<H3>The Object Request Broker</H3>

<P>An  <em>Object Request Broker (ORB)</em> is part of the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition, since version 1.3.  The ORB is a 
runtime component that can be used for distributed 
computing using IIOP communication. 

<P><STRONG>NOTE: Although it is true that ORBs written in 
different languages should be able to talk to each other, we haven't tested the 
interoperability of the Java ORB with other vendor's ORBs.</STRONG>

<P> The Object Management Group (OMG) is an industry consortium that
creates and publishes specifications for CORBA.  Vendors 
implement
the specifications to produce products known as Object Request Brokers
(ORB).  The good news for developers is that the Java<sup><font
size="-2">TM</font></sup> Standard Edition, v1.2 and higher includes an
 ORB that is available in every deployment of the Java 
2
Platform, Standard Edition.  To read more about 
the
<A HREF="../../api/org/omg/CORBA/ORB.html"><TT>ORB</TT></A> class, 
follow
the link.


<P>The Java CORBA ORB supports both the RMI and IDL programming models, 
both of which can use the underlying IIOP wire-level protocol for 
communication.

<H2>Introducing the CORBA Programming Models</H2>



<H3>History of the CORBA Programming Models</H3>

    

<P>In 1997, Remote Method Invocation, or RMI, was introduced in JDK 
1.1.  Initially, RMI was positioned as a natural outgrowth of Remote 
Procedure Calls (RPC), strictly for enabling calls to be made between 
Java  objects in different virtual machines, and even on different 
physical machines. 



<P>In 1998, came JDK 1.2, which introduced Java IDL, a Java API for interoperability and 
integration with CORBA.  Java IDL included both a Java-based ORB, which 
supported IIOP,  and the IDL-to-Java compiler, <TT>idltojava</TT>, for 
generating client-side stubs and server-side code skeletons. The ORB supports both the RMI over IIOP and Java IDL programming models.

<P>In 1999, the RMI over IIOP standard extension to the Java platform was
introduced for JDK 1.1.6 and 1.2.  Now that RMI over IIOP is integrated into J2SE version 1.3 and higher, the optional download has been end-of-lifed, but is still 
available from the archives.

<P>The OMG finalized modifications of its IIOP specification so that it 
would support most of the JDK 1.1 functionality of RMI.  RMI over IIOP was 
introduced as a standard extension to JDK 1.2.  This enabled remote objects written in the 
Java programming language to be accessible from any language via IIOP. 
  
<P>J2SE, v.1.3 introduced a new, 100% Pure Java<sup><font 
size="-2">TM</font></sup>, IDL-to-Java compiler, <TT>idlj</TT>, 
along with support for IDL abstract interfaces and value types.  Also in v.1.3, RMI over IIOP
is included in the JDK.

<P>J2SE v.1.4, the current version, was introduced in 2001, and includes
support for the Portable Object Adapter, Portable Interceptors, Interoperable
Naming Service, GIOP 1.2, and Dynamic Anys.  J2SE v.1.4 also includes an Object Request Broker Daemon (ORBD), which is used to enable clients to transparently locate and invoke persistent objects on servers in the CORBA
    environment, and <tt>servertool</tt>, which  provides a command-line interface for application programmers to register, unregister, startup, and
    shutdown a persistent server.  For more information on new features in J2SE v.1.4, see <a href="../idl/jidlChanges.html"><em>Changes in CORBA Features Between J2SE 1.3 and 1.4</em></a>.

<H3>Comparing the CORBA Programming Models</H3>

<P>Cross-language, cross-vendor 
interoperability is achieved via the Internet InterORB Protocol, or IIOP.  IIOP 
is a transport protocol for distributed applications written in either 
IDL or Java RMI.  

<P>When using the IDL programming model, the interface is everything!  
It defines the points of entry that can be called from a remote 
process, such as the types of arguments the called procedure will 
accept, or the value/output parameter of information returned.  Using 
IDL, the programmer can make the entry points and data types that pass 
between communicating processes act like a standard language.

<P>CORBA is a language-neutral system in which the argument values or 
return values are limited to what can be represented in the involved 
implementation languages.  In CORBA, object orientation is limited only 
to objects that can be passed by reference (the object code itself 
cannot be passed from machine-to-machine) or are predefined in the 
overall framework.  Passed and returned types must be those declared in 
the interface.

<P>With RMI, the interface and the implementation language are described in the 
same language, so you don't have to worry about mapping from one to the other.  
Language-level objects (the code itself) can be passed from one process 
to the next.  Values can be returned by their actual type, not the 
declared type.  Or, you can compile the interfaces to generate 
IIOP stubs and skeletons which allow your objects to be accessible from
other CORBA-compliant languages.

<A NAME="rmi"></A>
<H3>The RMI Programming Model</H3> 

<P><B>What is the RMI Programming Model</B></P>


<P>The RMI Programming model is a general object model for distributed computing 
via the <TT>rmi</TT> API.  You can choose to work completely within the Java programming 
language, using the Java Remote Method Protocol (JRMP) or work with other CORBA-compliant 
programming languages using the Internet InterORB Protocol (IIOP). 

 
<P>The RMI
 programming model is part of the Java<SUP><FONT 
SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> 2
Platform, Standard Edition, and consists of both an Object Request Broker (ORB)
and the <tt>rmic</tt> compiler.  The <TT>rmic</TT> compiler is used to generate
stubs, skeletons, and ties for remote objects using either the JRMP or IIOP
    protocols. The <TT>rmic</TT> compiler can also generates OMG IDL. 
 For more information 
on using <TT>rmic</TT>, link to <A 
HREF="../../tooldocs/solaris/rmic.html">rmic - The Java RMI Stub 
Compiler</A>.

<P>The <a href="../rmi-iiop/rmi_iiop_pg.html">RMI over IIOP Programmer's Guide</em></a> discusses the differences
between using RMI with JRMP or IIOP.

<P><B>When should I use the RMI programming model instead of the IDL programming model?</B></P>

<P>The RMI 
programming model speeds distributed application development by 
allowing developers to work completely in the Java programming 
language.  When using the RMI programming model to
produce Java technology-based distributed applications, there is no
separate Interface Definition Language (IDL) or mapping to learn.  The 
RMI programming model provides flexibility by allowing developers to 
pass any
serializable Java object (Objects By Value) between application 
components. Like the IDL programming model, the RMI programming model is based on open 
standards defined with the participation of hundreds of vendors and 
users in the Java Community Process (JCP).  Like the IDL programming model, the RMI programming 
model can use the Internet Inter-ORB Protocol (IIOP)
as its communication protocol.  IIOP eases legacy application and 
platform
integration by allowing application components written in C++, 
Smalltalk,
and other CORBA supported languages to communicate with components 
running
on the Java platform.

<P>With the RMI programming model, developers can write remote 
interfaces in the Java programming language and implement them simply 
using Java technology and
the Java RMI APIs.  These interfaces can be implemented in any other
language that is supported by an OMG mapping and a vendor supplied ORB 
for
that language.  Similarly, clients can be written in other languages 
using
IDL derived from the remote Java technology-based interfaces.

<P>
<A NAME="idl"></A>
<H3>The IDL Programming Model</H3> 

<P><B>What is the IDL Programming Model</B></P>

<P>The IDL programming model, known as Java<SUP><FONT 
SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> IDL, consists of both the Java CORBA ORB and 
the <TT>idlj</TT> compiler that maps the OMG IDL to Java bindings that use the 
Java CORBA ORB, as well as a set of APIs, which can be explored by selecting the <a href="../../api/"><tt>org.omg</tt></a> prefix from the Package section of the API index.

<P>Java IDL adds CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) capability to the Java platform, providing standards-based
    interoperability and connectivity. Java IDL enables distributed Web-enabled Java applications to transparently invoke operations on
    remote network services using the industry standard IDL (Object Management Group Interface Definition Language) and IIOP
    (Internet Inter-ORB Protocol) defined by the Object Management Group. Runtime components include a Java ORB for distributed
    computing using IIOP communication. 
    
<P>To use the IDL programming model, you define remote interfaces using the Object
Management Group's (OMG) Interface Definition Language (IDL), then compile the interfaces
using the <TT>idlj</TT> compiler. When you run the <TT>idlj</TT>  compiler over your interface definition file, it generates the Java version of
    the interface, as well as the class code files for the stubs and skeletons that enable your applications
    to hook into the ORB.  
    
    
<P> Java<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> IDL is part of the Java 2 
Platform, Standard Edition, v1.2 and above.  To develop applications with Java 
IDL, use <A HREF="../rmi-iiop/toJavaPortableUG.html">Java<SUP><FONT
SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> IDL Compiler</A>, <TT>idlj</TT>,  which is included in every 
installation of J2SE v1.3 and higher.  </P>





<P><B>When should I use the IDL programming model instead of the RMI programming model?</B></P>

<P>The OMG IDL (Interface Definition Language) is a purely declarative
language designed for specifying programming-language-independent
operational interfaces for distributed applications.  OMG specifies a
mapping from IDL to several different programming languages, including Java, 
C,
C++, Lisp, Python, Smalltalk, COBOL, and Ada.  When mapped, each statement in 
OMG
IDL is translated to a corresponding statement in the programming 
language
of choice. Java IDL is an implementation of the CORBA specification. 
For example, you could use the Java IDL Compiler, <TT>idlj</TT>, to map 
an IDL
interface to Java and implement the client class in Java.  If you map 
the
same IDL to C++, using an IDL-to-C++ compiler and a C++ ORB, and implement the server in that 
language, the Java 
client
and C++ server interoperate through the ORB.  </P>

<P><STRONG>NOTE: Although it is true that ORBs written in 
different languages should be able to talk to each other, we haven't tested the 
interoperability of the Java ORB with other vendor's ORBs.</STRONG>

 <P> 
 
 <H3>Comparison of IDL and RMI programming models</H3>
 
 
 <P>There are several scenarios that will define how you will want to 
create distributed CORBA applications.  Here are some of them:
 
 <P>
 <UL>
 <LI>If you have been developing CORBA applications using <A 
HREF="../idl/index.html">IDL</A> for some 
time, you will probably want to stay in this environment.  Create the 
interfaces using IDL, and define the client and server applications 
using the Java programming language to take advantage of its "Write 
Once, Run Anywhere<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP>" portability, 
its  highly productive implementation environment, and its very robust 
platform.  
 <P>
 <LI>If all of your applications are written in the Java programming 
language, you will probably want to use <A HREF="../rmi/">Java RMI</A> to enable 
communication between Java objects on different virtual machines and 
different physical machines.  Using Java RMI without its IIOP option 
leverages its strengths of code portability, security, and garbage 
collection.
 <P>
 <LI>If you are writing most of your new applications using the Java 
programming language, but need to maintain legacy applications written 
in other programming languages as well, you will probably want to use 
Java RMI with its <A HREF="../rmi-iiop/">IIOP</A> compiler option.  
 </UL>


<H2>What about CORBA and J2EE?</H2>

<P>In addition to Java IDL and RMI over IIOP, J2EE includes Enterprise JavaBeans<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> technology (EJB<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP>).

<P><a href="../../../../../products/ejb/index.html">Enterprise JavaBeans</a> is part of the Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition. The EJB server-side component model simplifies development of middleware components that are transactional, scalable, and portable. EJB servers reduce the complexity of developing middleware by providing automatic support for
 middleware services such as transactions, security, database connectivity, and more. 

<P>EJBs use RMI over IIOP for their distributed object model, and use the Java Transaction Service (JTS) for their distributed transaction model. When Enterprise JavaBeans are implemented using the RMI over IIOP protocol for EJB interoperability in heterogeneous server environments, the standard
 mapping of the EJB architecture to CORBA enables the following interoperability: 
 <P><UL>
 <LI>A Java client using an ORB from one vendor can access enterprise beans residing on an EJB server provided by another vendor. 

<LI>Enterprise beans in one EJB server can access enterprise beans in another EJB server.
 <LI> A non-Java platform CORBA client can access any enterprise bean object.
