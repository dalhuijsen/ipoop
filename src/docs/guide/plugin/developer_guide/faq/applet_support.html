<p><b>Q: Why should I encourage people to use the Java 2 Platform?</b> <br>
</p>
<p><b>A:</b> The Java 2 Platform is richer than its predecessors in functionality, 
  performance, and security options. As a developer, you want the users of your 
  software to have the most feature-complete Java platform possible so that the 
  full range of APIs and libraries are available for your applications. If your 
  customers are using the Java 2 Platform, you can write more powerful, robust, 
  and full-featured applications and applets. And with the Java 2 Platform the 
  performance of your code will be better too. 
<p> By using the latest Java Plug-in with <tt>APPLET</tt> tag support, you can 
  help to ensure that clients running your applets will have the latest Java 2 
  Platform. </p>
<p> <b>Q: Can I continue to use <tt>OBJECT</tt> tags to call my applets?</b> </p>
<p> <b>A:</b> Yes. Even though the Java Plug-in has been enhanced to support <tt>APPLET</tt> 
  tags, it is fully backward compatible with existing web pages that use <tt>OBJECT</tt> 
  tags to launch applets. Moreover, the JRE/Java Plug-in continues to ship with 
  the HTML Converter for those developers who want to invoke their applets using 
  <tt>OBJECT</tt> rather than <tt>APPLET</tt> tags. </p>
<p> <b>Q: Are there compatibility issues with using the Java 2 Platform?</b> </p>
<p><b>A:</b> In the large majority of cases, there are no compatibility issues 
  to be concerned about when moving from JDK 1.1 to the Java 2 Platform. The documentation 
  for a given Java 2 Platform release describes all known incompatibilities, most 
  of which are in the category of "corner cases." For example, known compatibility 
  issues in version 1.4 of the Java 2 Platform are described at <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/compatibility.html"><tt>http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/compatibility.html</tt></a>. 
<p> Some old class files generated by early bytecode compilers do not strictly 
  conform to the proper class-file format, and the Java 2 Runtime Environment 
  may not load such classes.</p>
<p> In addition to compatibility issues between different releases of the Java 
  platform, there is the question of incompatibilities between Sun's Java runtime 
  environment and other Java runtime environments; e.g., the one included with 
  some Internet Explorer browsers. Sun has made a great effort to minimize such 
  incompatibilities. Among the steps that Sun as taken in this JRE/Java Plug-in 
  are the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The classloader sharing policy in Java Plug-in has been changed to minimize 
    incompatible behavior in applets that depend explicitly on the classloader 
    sharing policy of the Microsoft VM. </li>
  <li>The image and sound resource lookup sequence in Java Plug-in has been changed 
    to give resources specified with the HTML <tt>archive</tt> paramater priority 
    over those on the <tt>codebase</tt> URL. This change was made to minimize 
    incompatible behavior for applets that rely explicitly on the resource lookup 
    sequence employed by the Microsoft VM. </li>
  <li>The implementation of <tt>AppletgetParameter()</tt> has been modified to 
    strip off leading and trailing whitespace from parameters before they are 
    returned to the applet. This is the behavior of the Microsoft VM in some Internet 
    Explorer browsers, and this change was made to eliminate possible incompatibile 
    behavior in applets that rely explicitly on that behavior. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Q: What security model does Java Plug-in use?</b> </p>
<p> <b>A:</b> JRE/Java Plug-in is a product in the Java 2 Platform family, and 
  it uses the new Java 2 Platform's security model. This security model is more 
  flexible and configurable than the security model used by JDK 1.1. For more 
  information, see the Java 2 Platform's security documentation at <tt><a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/security/">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/security/index.html</a></tt>. 
</p>
<p> Note that applets that rely explicitly on proprietary technology in the security 
  model of the Microsoft VM may not work with Java Plug-in. </p>
<p> <b>Q: My applet fails with a <code>ClassFormatError</code>. What's wrong?</b> 
</p>
<p> <b>A:</b> This problem may be caused by bytecode generated by old compilers. 
  Such bytecode may not conform to the virtual machine specification, which is 
  more strictly enforced by recent releases of the JRE.</p>
<p> <b>Q: Why doesn't Java Plug-in load my applet's cab file?</b> </p>
<p> <b>A:</b> The Java Plug-in supports applet packaging in <code>.jar</code> 
  files. It does not support the Microsoft proprietary <i><code>.</code></i><code>cab</code> 
  file format. Therefore any applets packaged in Microsoft's <i><code>.</code></i><code>cab 
  file</code> format will not load in JRE/Java Plug-in. </p>
<p> <b>Q: Will my Authenticode-signed applet work with Sun's JRE/Java Plug-in?</b> 
</p>
<p><b>A: </b>No. The Sun JRE/Java Plug-in does not support Microsoft proprietary 
  technology such as Authenicode signing and <i><code>.</code></i><code>cab</code> 
  file formats. Signed applets that rely on Microsoft's Authenticode technology 
  will not load in JRE/Java Plug-in. </p>
<p> <b>Q: My applet uses J/Direct, AFC, and WFC, etc. Will it work in Sun's JRE/Java 
  Plug-in?</b> </p>
<p><b>A: </b>No. Libraries for these and other proprietary Microsoft technologies 
  are not included with JRE/Java Plug-in. Applets that rely on these Microsoft 
  proprietary technologies will not work properly when run on JRE/Java Plug-in. 
</p>
<p> <b>Q: Why does my applet throw a <code>NullPointerException</code> from the 
  AWT Dispatch Event thread?</b> </p>
<p><b>A:</b> The events that occur during applet startup and shutdown may differ 
  between the Microsoft and Sun implementation of the Java platform. For example, 
  the logic in an applet may rely on the applet being visible when <tt>Applet.start()</tt>/<tt>Applet.stop()</tt> 
  is called. That condition may be true when the applet is run on Microsoft's 
  implementation but may not be true on Sun's impelementation. </p>
<p> Applets that rely on specific events that occur during startup and shutdown 
  on Microsoft's implementation of the Java platform may not work properly with 
  JRE/Java Plug-in. The most common symptom of this type of problem is a <tt>NullPointerException</tt> 
  from the AWT Dispatch Event thread. </p>
<p> <b>Q: Why does my applet throw a <code>ClassCastException</code> from the 
  AWT Dispatch Event thread?</b> </p>
<p><b>A:</b> The number of containers between the applet and the encompassing 
  frame are different in the Microsoft and Sun implementations. Therefore, an 
  applet that relies on the frame being at some particular level of containment 
  in the Microsoft VM, without navigating the entire AWT hierarchical component 
  tree, is likely to fail when run on Sun's JRE/Java Plug-in. The most common 
  symptom of this problem is a <tt>ClassCastException</tt> from the AWT Dispatch 
  Event thread. </p>
<p> <b>Q: Does Java Plug-in support Java-JavaScript communication?</b> </p>
<p><b>A:</b> Yes, Java Plug-in supports basic, bidirectional Java-JavaScript communication. 
  The following, however, is a known incompatibility. </p>
<p> In the Microsoft implementation, applet methods and properties exposed in 
  JavaScript are exactly the same as the methods and fields in the applet object. 
  In Java Plug-in, an applet's methods and properties are exposed in JavaScript 
  through JavaBeans<sup><font 
size="-2">TM</font></sup> introspection, which treats the applet's fields in a 
  different manner than the Microsoft VM. Therefore, JavaScript accessing fields 
  in an applet object may not work the same when run on JRE/Java Plug-in. </p>
