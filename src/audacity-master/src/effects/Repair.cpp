\class EffectRepair
\brief Use the interpolation code to fill in damaged audio.
Damage can include pops, clicks, or clipping.  As long as the
damaged section is short and surrounded by lots of good audio,
it is usually quite successful.

This was formerly the PopClickRemoval effect, but it was
renamed and focused on the smaller subproblem of repairing
the audio, rather than actually finding the clicks.
