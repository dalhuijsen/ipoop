  <A NAME="1.0">
  <H2>1.0 Java<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> Logging Overview</H2>

  <P>
    The logging APIs are described in detail in the 
    <a href="../../../api/java/util/logging/package-summary.html">J2SE API Specification</a>.
    The goal of this document 
    is to provide an overview of key elements. 
  </P>

   <A NAME="1.1">
  <H3>1.1 Overview of Control Flow</H3>
  <P>
    Applications make logging calls on <I>Logger</I> objects. 
    Loggers are organized in a hierarchical namespace and child 
    Loggers may inherit some logging properties from their parents 
    in the namespace.
  </P>
  <P>
    Applications make logging calls on <I>Logger</I> objects. 
    These Logger objects allocate <I>LogRecord</I> objects 
    which are passed to <I>Handler</I> objects for publication. 
    Both Loggers and Handlers may use logging 
    <I>Levels</I> and (optionally) <I>Filters</I> to decide if they are 
    interested in a particular <I>LogRecord</I>. When it is necessary to 
    publish a LogRecord externally, a Handler can (optionally) use a 
    <I>Formatter</I> to localize and format the message before publishing
    it to an I/O stream.
  </P>

  <P>
  <CENTER>
 <IMG SRC="logging1.gif" alt="The previous context describes this graphic"> 
  </CENTER>
  </P>

  <P>
   Each Logger keeps track of a set of output Handlers. By default all 
   Loggers also send their output to their parent Logger. But Loggers may
   also be configured to ignore Handlers higher up the tree.
  </P>

  <P>
  Some Handlers may direct output to other Handlers. For example, 
  the <I>MemoryHandler</I> maintains an internal ring buffer of
  <I>LogRecords</I> and on trigger events it publishes its LogRecords
  through a target Handler. In such cases, any formatting is done
  by the last Handler in the chain. 
  </P>

  <P>
  <CENTER>
 <IMG SRC="logging2.gif" alt="The previous context describes this graphic">  
 </CENTER>
  </P>

  <P>
  The APIs are structured so that calls on the Logger APIs can be cheap when 
  logging is disabled. If logging is disabled for a given log level, then the
  Logger can make a cheap comparison test and return. If logging is enabled
  for a given log level, the Logger is still careful to minimize costs
  before passing the LogRecord into the Handlers. In particular, localization
  and formatting (which are relatively expensive) are deferred until the 
  Handler requests them. For example, a MemoryHandler can maintain a circular
  buffer of LogRecords without having to pay formatting costs.
  </P>


  <A NAME="1.2">
  <H3>1.2 Log Levels</H3>
  <P>
  Each log message has an associated log <I>Level</I>. The Level gives a 
  rough guide to the importance and urgency of a log message. Log level
  objects encapsulate an integer value, with higher values indicating
  higher priorities. 
  </P> 
  <P>
  The <TT>Level</TT> class defines seven standard log levels, ranging from
  FINEST (the lowest priority, with the lowest value) to SEVERE (the highest
  priority, with the highest value).
  <P>

   <A NAME="1.3">
  <H3>1.3 Loggers</H3>
  <P>
  As stated earlier, client code sends log requests 
  to Logger objects. Each logger keeps track of a log level that 
  it is interested in, and discards log requests that are below this level.
  </P>

  <P>
  Loggers are normally named entities, using dot-separated names 
  such as &quot;java.awt&quot;. The namespace is hierarchical and is
  managed by the LogManager. The namespace should typically be aligned with 
  the Java packaging namespace, but is not required to follow it slavishly.
  For example, a Logger called &quot;java.awt&quot; might handle logging 
  requests for classes in the java.awt package, but it might also handle 
  logging for classes in sun.awt that support the client-visible abstractions
  defined in the java.awt package.
  </P> 

  <P>
  In addition to named Loggers, it is also possible to create 
  anonymous Loggers that don't appear in the shared namespace. See section 
  <a href="#1.14">1.14</a>.
  </P>

  <p>
  Loggers keep track of their parent loggers in the logging namespace.
  A logger's parent is its nearest extant ancestor in the logging namespace.
  The root Logger (named "") has no parent. Anonymous loggers are all given
  the root logger as their parent. Loggers may inherit various attributes
  from their parents in the logger namespace. In particular, a logger may
  inherit:
  <UL>
  <LI>Logging level. If a Logger's level is set to be null then the Logger
      will use an effective Level that will be obtained by walking up the parent
      tree and using the first non-null Level.
  <LI>Handlers. By default a Logger will log any output messages to its
      parent's handlers, and so on recursively up the tree.
  <LI>Resource bundle names. If a logger has a null resource bundle name, then
      it will inherit any resource bundle name defined for its parent, and so
      on recursively up the tree.
  </UL>
  </P>

 <A NAME="1.4">
  
  <H3>1.4 Logging Methods</H3>

  <P>
  The Logger class provides a large set of convenience methods 
  for generating log messages. For convenience, there are methods
  for each logging level, named after the logging level name. Thus
  rather than calling &quot;logger.log(Constants.WARNING,...&quot;
  a developer can simply call the convenience method
  &quot;logger.warning(...&quot;
  </P>

  <P>
  There are two different styles of logging methods, to meet
  the needs of different communities of users.
  </P>

  <P>
  First, there are methods that take an explicit source class name and 
  source method name. These methods are intended for developers who want
  to be able to quickly locate the source of any given logging message. 
  An example of this style is: 

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <TT>
     void warning(String sourceClass, String sourceMethod, String msg);
    </TT>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  </P>

  <P>
  Second, there are a set of methods that do not take explicit source class
  or source method names. These are intended for developers who want
  easy-to-use logging and do not require detailed source information.  

 <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <TT>
     void warning(String msg);
    </TT>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  </P>

  <P>
  For this second set of methods, the Logging framework will make
  a &quot;best effort&quot; to determine which class and method called
  into the logging framework and will add this information into the 
  LogRecord. However, it is important to realize that this automatically
  inferred information may only be approximate. The latest generation of
  virtual machines perform extensive optimizations when JITing and may entirely
  remove stack frames, making it impossible to reliably locate the calling
  class and method. 
  </P>

 <A NAME="1.5">
  
  <H3>1.5 Handlers</H3>

  <P>
  J2SE provides the following Handlers:
  <UL>
    <LI><I>StreamHandler:</I> A simple handler for writing formatted
                              records to an OutputStream. 
    <LI><I>ConsoleHandler:</I> A simple handler for writing formatted
                              records to System.err
    <LI><I>FileHandler:</I> A handler that writes formatted log records 
                            either to a single file, or to a set of rotating
                            log files. 
    <LI><I>SocketHandler:</I> A handler that writes formatted log records to 
                              remote TCP ports. 
    <LI><I>MemoryHandler:</I> A handler that buffers log records in memory.
  </UL>
  </P>

  <P>
    It is fairly straightforward to develop new Handlers. Developers requiring
    specific functionality can either develop a Handler from scratch or
    subclass one of the provided Handlers. 
  </P>


 <A NAME="1.6">

 <H3>1.6 Formatters</H3>
  J2SE also includes two standard Formatters:
  <UL>
    <LI><I>SimpleFormatter</I>: Writes brief &quot;human-readable&quot;
                               summaries of log records.
    <LI><I>XMLFormatter</I>: Writes detailed XML-structured information.
  </UL>
  <P>
  As with Handlers, it is fairly straightforward to develop new
  Formatters. 
  </P>



  <A NAME="1.7">
  <H3>1.7 The LogManager</H3>
  There is a global LogManager object that keeps track of global logging
  information. This includes:
  <UL>
    <LI>A hierarchical namespace of named Loggers.
    <LI>A set of logging control properties read from the 
        configuration file. See section <a href="#1.8">1.8</a>.
  </UL>
   
  <P>
    There is a single LogManager object that can be retrieved using the
    static LogManager.getLogManager method. This is created during LogManager
    initialization, based on a system property. This property allows container
    applications (such as EJB containers) to substitute their own subclass
    of LogManager in place of the default class.  
  </P>

  <A NAME="1.8">
  <H3>1.8 Configuration File</H3>
  <P>
  The logging configuration can be initialized using a logging 
  configuration file that will be read at startup. This logging
  configuration file is in standard java.util.Properties format. 
  </P>


  <P>
  Alternatively, the logging configuration can be initialized by specifying
  a class that can be used for reading initialization properties. This 
  mechanism allows configuration data to be read from arbitrary sources, 
  such as LDAP. JDBC, etc. See the 
  <A HREF="../../../api/java/util/logging/LogManager.html">
  LogManager API Specification</A> for details.
  </P>

  <P>
  There is a small set of global configuration information. This is specified
  in the description of the LogManager class and includes a list of
  root-level Handlers to install during startup.
  </P>

  <P>
  The initial configuration may specify levels for particular loggers. 
  These levels are applied to the named logger and any loggers below
  it in the naming hierarchy. The levels are applied in the order
  they are defined in the configuration file.  
  </P>

  <P>
  The initial configuration may contain arbitrary properties for use
  by Handlers or by subsystems doing logging. By convention these 
  properties should use names starting with the name of the handler class
  or the name of the main Logger for the subsystem.
  </P>

  <P>
  For example, the MemoryHandler uses a property 
  &quot;java.util.logging.MemoryHandler.size&quot;
  to determine the default size for its ring buffer. 
  </P>

  <A NAME = "1.9">
  <H3>1.9 Default Configuration</H3>
   <P>
   The default logging configuration that ships with the JRE is only 
   a default, and can be overridden by ISVs, system admins, and end 
   users. 
   </P>

   <P>
   The default configuration makes only limited use of disk space.
   It doesn't flood the user with information, but does make sure
   to always capture key failure information.
   </P>

   <P>
   The default configuration establishes a single handler on the
   rootr logger for sending output to the console.
   </P>

  <A NAME = "1.10">
   <H3>1.10 Dynamic Configuration Updates</H3>
    Programmers can update the logging configuration at run time in a variety 
    of ways:

    <UL>
      <LI>FileHandlers,MemoryHandlers, and PrintHandlers can all be
          created with various attributes.
      <LI>New Handlers can be added and old ones removed.
      <LI>New Loggers can be created and can be supplied with specific
          Handlers. 
      <LI>Levels can be set on target Handlers.
    </UL>

  <A NAME = "1.11">
  <H3>1.11 Native Methods</H3>

  There are no native APIs for logging.

  <P>
  Native code that wishes to use the Java Logging mechanisms should
  make normal JNI calls into the Java Logging APIs.
  </P>

  <A NAME = "1.12">
  <H3>1.12 XML DTD</H3>
   <P>
   The XML DTD used by the XMLFormatter in specified in 
   <a href="#3.0">Appendix A</a>.
   </P> 
   The DTD is designed with a &quot;&lt;log&gt;&quot; element as 
   the top-level document. Individual log records are then written as
   &quot;&lt;record&gt;&quot; elements.

   <P>
   Note that in the event of JVM crashes it may not be possible to
   cleanly terminate an XMLFormatter stream with the appropriate
   closing &lt;/log&gt;. Therefore tools that are analyzing log records
   should be prepared to cope with un-terminated streams.
   </P>

   <A NAME = "1.13">
   <H3>1.13 Unique Message IDs</H3>
   <P>
    The Java Logging APIs do not provide any direct support for 
    unique message IDs. Those applications or subsystems requiring 
    unique message IDs should define their own conventions and include
    the unique IDs in the message strings as appropriate.
   </P>


  <A NAME ="1.14">
  <H3>1.14 Security</H3>

  <P>
   The principal security requirement is that untrusted code should
   not be able to change the logging configuration. Specifically, if the
   logging configuration has been set up to log a particular category of
   information to a particular Handler, then untrusted code should not be able
   to prevent or disrupt that logging.
  </P>

  <P>
  A new security permission LoggingPermission is defined to control
  updates to the logging configuration.
  </P>

  <P>
  Trusted applications are given the appropriate LoggingPermission
  so they can call any of the logging configuration APIs. Untrusted applets
  are a different story. Untrusted applets can create and use named Loggers
  in the normal way, but they are not allowed to change logging control
  settings, such as adding or removing handlers, or changing log levels. 
  However, untrusted applets are able to create and use their own 
  &quot;anonymous&quot; loggers, using Logger.getAnonymousLogger. These 
  anonymous Loggers are not registered in the global namespace and their
  methods are not access-checked, allowing even untrusted code to change
  their logging control settings. 
  </P>

  <P>
  The logging framework does not attempt to prevent spoofing. The sources
  of logging calls cannot be determined reliably, so when a LogRecord is
  published that claims to be from a particular source class and source method,
  it may be a fabrication. Similarly, formatters such as the XMLFormatter do
  not attempt to protect themselves against nested log messages inside 
  message strings. This, a spoof LogRecord might contain a spoof set of XML
  inside its message string to make it look as if there was an additional
  XML record in the output.
  </P>

  <P>
  In addition, the logging framework does not attempt to protect
  itself against denial of service attacks. Any given logging client
  can flood the logging framework with meaningless messages in an
  attempt to conceal some important log message.
  </P>

  <A NAME = "1.15">
  <H3>1.15 Configuration Management</H3>

<P>
  The APIs are structured so that an initial set of configuration
  information is read as properties from a configuration file. The configuration
  information may then be changed programatically by calls on the various logging
  classes and objects.
</P>

<P>
In addition, there are methods on LogManager that allow the configuration file
to be re-read. When this happens, the configuration file values will override any
changes that have been made programatically.
</P>


  <A NAME = "1.16">
  <H3>1.16 Packaging</H3>
  <P>
  All of the logging class are in the java.* part of the namespace, in the
  java.util.logging package.
  </P>

  <A NAME = "1.17">
  <H3>1.17 Localization</H3>
  <P>
  Log messages may need to be localized.
  </P>
  <P>
   Each Logger may have a Resource Bundle name associated with it. The
   corresponding Resource Bundle can be used to map between raw message
   strings and localized message strings.
  </P>
  <P>
  Normally localization will be performed by Formatters. As a convenience,
  the formatter class provides a formatMessage method that provides some
  basic localization and formatting support.
  </P>

  <A NAME = "1.18">
  <H3>1.18 Remote Access and Serialization</H3>

  <P>
  As with most Java platform APIs, the logging APIs are designed
  for use inside a single address space. All calls are intended to be local.
  However, it is expected that some Handlers will want to forward their
  output to other systems. There are a variety of ways of doing this:
  </P>
  
  <P>
  Some Handlers (such as the SocketHandler) may write data to other systems
  using the XMLFormatter. This provides a simple, standard, inter-change format
  that can be parsed and processed on a variety of systems.
  </P>

  <P>
  Some Handlers may wish to pass LogRecord objects over RMI. The LogRecord
  class is therefore serializable. However there is a problem in how to deal
  with the LogRecord parameters. Some parameters may not be serializable and
  other parameters may have been designed to serialize much more state than
  is required for logging. To avoid these problems the LogRecord class has
  a custom writeObject method that converts the parameters to strings (using
  Object.toString()) before writing them out. See the 
  <a href="../../../api/java/util/logging/LogRecord.html">LogRecord API 
  Specification</a> for details.
  </P>

  <P>
  Most of the logging classes are not intended to be serializable. Both Loggers
  and Handlers are stateful classes that are tied into a specific virtual 
  machine. In this respect they are analogous to the java.io classes, which
  are also not serializable.
  </P>
