<h1>JTabbedPane: Scrollable Tabs</h1>

<p>Previously with <code>JTabbedPane</code>, if all the tabs did not
fit within a single tab run, the <code>JTabbedPane</code> wrapped tabs onto
multiple runs. There have been many requests to provide an alternative scheme,
where the <code>JTabbedPane</code> would
instead display a single, scrollable run of tabs. This document describes the new
API for providing such scrollable tab support in <code>JTabbedPane</code> for the 1.4
release. The bugtraq report that corresponds to this change is:
<a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4093898.html">4093898</a>.

<h3><a name="too_many">The Too-Many-Tabs Dilemma</a></h3>

<p>Wrapping tabs onto multiple lines provides the benefit of
always allowing the user to view all
possible tab selections at a given time:

<p><img src="../../../images/wintabs0.gif" alt="Graphic with two rows of tabs. The first row has five, the second row has four." align=center>

<p>However, the problem with multiple runs is
in handling the case where the user selects a tab in a run which is not
adjacent to the panel display area. For the Windows and Motif look and feel
implementations, this action will cause the runs to rotate such that the run
containing the selected tab is placed adjacent to the panel display area.

<p><img src="../../../images/wintabs.gif" alt="Graphic with selected tab adjacent to panel display area" align=center>

<p>This behavior can be extremely disorienting to the user because it constantly
re-arranges the tabs, eliminating predictability in the UI.
The Metal look and feel solved this problem by always
leaving the runs fixed, even if the selected tab is not adjacent to the panel
display area:

<p><img src="../../../images/metaltabs.gif" alt="Graphic with selected tab is denoted by different color"align=center>

<p>Unfortunately the downside of the Metal solution is that it visually departs
from the 'tabbed folder' metaphor (the selected tab is not 'attached' to its content).
In fact, Chapter 7 of the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jlf/">Java Look and Feel
Guidelines</a> recommends against creating tabbed panes with multiple runs:

<p>&quot;If your tabbed pane requires multiple rows of tabs, consider
dividing the content among several dialog boxes or components. Multiple rows of
tabs can be confusing.&quot;

<p>While constraining tabs in a tabbed pane to a number which will fit within a
single run is an important UI guideline, there are circumstances where a
proliferation of tabs cannot be avoided. This is often the case if the tabs are
created dynamically by the application at runtime (perhaps driven off the
content of a database).

<p>An alternate solution for handling the tab proliferation case is to
constrain the tabbed pane to a single, scrollable run of tabs: 

<p><img src="../../../images/scrolltabs.gif" alt="Graphic with a single row of tabs that does not include all the possible choices" align=center>

<p>Naturally, this solution has its own set of usability problems, the most
obvious of which is that the user can no longer view all possible selections at
one time. However, this scrollable-tab behavior is becoming increasingly common
in user interfaces and therefore Swing now supports it as an option.

<h3><a name=api>New </a><code>JTabbedPane</code> API</h3>

<p>To allow programs to define which tab layout behavior they require,
we now provide a &quot;tabLayoutPolicy&quot; bound property on
<a href="../../../api/javax/swing/JTabbedPane.html"><code>JTabbedPane</code></a>:

<pre>
    public void <a href="../../../api/javax/swing/JTabbedPane.html#setTabLayoutPolicy(int)">setTabLayoutPolicy(int layoutPolicy)</a>

    public boolean <a href="../../../api/javax/swing/JTabbedPane.html#getTabLayoutPolicy()">getTabLayoutPolicy()</a>
</pre>

<p>Additionally, constants for the supported policy values have been added to
<a href="../../../api/javax/swing/JTabbedPane.html"><code>JTabbedPane</code></a>:

<pre>
    public static final int <a href="../../../api/javax/swing/JTabbedPane.html#WRAP_TAB_LAYOUT">WRAP_TAB_LAYOUT = 0;</a>

    public static final int <a href="../../../api/javax/swing/JTabbedPane.html#SCROLL_TAB_LAYOUT">SCROLL_TAB_LAYOUT = 1;</a>
</pre>

<h3><a name=compat>Compatibility</a></h3>

<p>This feature had no impact on compatibility,
as the default value for the <code>tabLayoutPolicy</code> property is 
<code>WRAP_TAB_LAYOUT</code> which matches the previous layout
behavior of the tabbed pane.
