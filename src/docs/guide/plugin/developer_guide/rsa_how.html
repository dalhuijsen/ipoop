<h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p> This page provides an overview of how RSA signed applet support is implemented 
  in Java<font size="-2"></font> Plug-in. For an overview of how to use RSA signed 
  applets, see <a href=rsa_deploying.html>How to Deploy RSA-Signed Applets in 
  Java Plug-in</a>. 
<h2><a name="verification"></a>Support for RSA Verification</h2>
<p> So that Java Plug-in can verify RSA signatures in a browser-independent way, 
  Java Plug-in includes a Cryptographic Service Provider (CSP). The CSP supports 
  the "MD2withRSA", "MD5withRSA", and "SHA1withRSA" digital signature algorithms. 
  It is automatically registered with the Java Cryptographic Architecture framework 
  as part of the static initializer of the <code>PluginClassLoader</code>. 
<h2><a name="trust"></a>Support for Dynamic Trust Management</h2>
<p> Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition v 1.3 introduced fine-grained access control 
  based on "codesource" and "protection domain," as described below:
<p> Every class that is loaded from a JAR file has a codesource, which encapsulates 
  two pieces of information: 
<ol>
  <li>The location (URL) where the class came from;</li>
  <li>The list of principals who signed it (its certificates). </li>
</ol>
<p>Each signer principal in the codesource is represented by its X.509 public-key 
  certificate and supporting certificate chain. </p>
<p> In addition, every class that is loaded by a classloader belongs to one and 
  only one protection domain, based on its codesource (i.e., based on where the 
  class came from and who signed it). Every protection domain has a set of permissions 
  associated with it, based on the configured security policy. This means that 
  a protection domain encapsulates two things: 
<ol>
  <li>A codesource;</li>
  <li>The set of permissions granted to it.</li>
</ol>
<p>A certificate chain is a list of hierarchically ordered public-key certificates, 
  starting at the signer's public-key certificate and ending at the certificate 
  of a Root Certification Authority ("Root CA"). The public key of one certificate 
  in the chain is used to verify the signature on the previous certificate in 
  the chain. The Root CA certificate is self-signed. The assumption is that the 
  Root CA is trusted because it is well known and widely published.
<p> The <code>PluginClassLoader</code> checks the configured security policy to 
  determine which permissions to grant to a given codesource. The codesource and 
  the set of permissions granted to it then form a protection domain. This behaviour 
  is common to all secure classloaders (i.e., instances of <tt>java.security.SecureClassLoader</tt>). 
  (Note: <tt>sun.plugin.security.PluginClassLoader</tt> extends <tt>sun.applet.AppletClassLoader</tt>, 
  which is a subclass of <tt>java.net.URLClassLoader</tt>, which in turn extends 
  <tt>java.security.SecureClassLoader</tt>.) 
<p> The <code>PluginClassLoader</code> does additional work: If the applet is 
  signed, and the permissions granted to it do not include the special <a href="#use"><code>usePolicy</code></a> 
  permission, the <code>PluginClassLoader</code> extracts the signers (and their 
  supporting certificate chains) from the applet's codesource and attempts to 
  verify them.
<p> If Plug-in can verify the certificate chain all the way up to its Root CA 
  certificate, it checks if that Root CA certificate is contained in the database 
  of trusted Root CA certificates. If so, Plug-in will display the certificate 
  chain of the authenticated signer and ask the user whether or not to grant <code>AllPermission</code> 
  to code signed by that principal. Java code that is assigned the <code>AllPermission</code> 
  permission is treated the same as system code, meaning it has all the privileges 
  that system code has. The user can then choose whether or not to grant <code>AllPermission</code> 
  to code signed by that principal, and whether such permission should be granted 
  to any code signed by that principal for all subsequent sessions or for the 
  current session only. 
<p>(For the case of unsigned applets, or signed applets whose permissions include 
  the <code>usePolicy</code>, see <a href="security.html">Overview&#151;Applet 
  Security Basics</a>.)
<h2><a name="use"></a><code>usePolicy</code> Permission</h2>
<p> A permission named <code>usePolicy</code> (introduced with version 1.3) allows 
  system administrators to turn off the <code>PluginClassLoader</code> behaviour. 
  If the <code>usePolicy</code> permission is granted to the codesource by the 
  configured security policy, no user prompting will take place; only the permissions 
  specified in the security policy will be granted to the codesource.</p>
