<h3> <a name="whom"></a>For Whom This Guide Is Intended</h3>
<p> This guide is intended for three groups of readers: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Application developers: software programmers who want to write Java<font size="-1"><sup>TM</sup></font> 
    applications or applets using audio or MIDI. Most readers will fall into this 
    category. 
  <li>Service providers: developers of software modules that extend the capabilities 
    of an implementation of the Java Sound application programming interface (API). 
    For example, a vendor might provide a new audio mixer or MIDI synthesizer, 
    or the ability to read and write a new file format. The Java Sound API is 
    designed to let programs automatically access all such "plug-in" modules available 
    on a particular system. 
  <li>API implementors: developers creating new implementations of the Java Sound 
    API. 
</ul>
<p>It is assumed that the reader has a basic knowledge of programming in the Java 
  language. Familiarity with audio and MIDI is helpful but not assumed. </p>
<p></p>
<h3><a name="what"></a>What This Guide Describes</h3>
<p> This is a largely conceptual description of the Java Sound API, with some 
  code snippets as programming examples. The Java Sound API specifies a software 
  layer that allows application programs to communicate with an audio and MIDI 
  engine. The Java Sound API is part of the Java<font size="-1"><sup>TM</sup></font> 
  2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE), version 1.3, which is the version described 
  by this guide. The sound API is included in both the Java 2 Software Development 
  Kit (SDK), Standard Edition, and the Java 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition. 
  Earlier implementations of the Java Sound API were supplied as a separate products 
  and their programming interfacea differ from the one described here.</p>

      <p><font size="+2"><b>Note:</b></font></p>
      <p>This guide is not a description of any particular implementation of the 
        Java Sound API.<b> </b>In particular, it does not specifically describe 
        the reference implementation of the Java Sound API created by Sun Microsystems, 
        Inc. For example, you will not find here a list of exactly which sound 
        file formats are supported in the reference implementation. (Because the 
        Java Sound API makes "plug-in" services possible, API implementors and/or 
        third parties can add support for new formats, ports with special features, 
        etc.) In general, this guide ignores unique features, extensions, limitations, 
        or bugs of a particular implementation. </p>
      <p>As a convenience for developers, it does make note of some current limitations 
        of Sun's reference implemenation. If you are having problems, it is highly 
        recommended that you consult:</p>
