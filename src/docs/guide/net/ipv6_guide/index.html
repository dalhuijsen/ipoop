<h2><a name="overview"></a>Overview </h2>
<p>With the J2SDK/JRE 1.4 release, IPv6 support has been added to Java Networking. 
  This will make J2SE compliant with the following standards (RFCs):</p>
<ul>
  <li>RFC2373: IPv6 Addressing Architecture; </li>
  <li>RFC 2553: BasicSocket Interface Extensions for IPv6; </li>
  <li>RFC 2732: Format for Literal IPv6 Addresses in URLs. </li>
</ul>
<p>Since the J2SDK does not support raw sockets, RFC 2292 (: Advanced Sockets 
  API for IPv6) is not supported in this release.</p>
<p>Other interesting features of IPv6, such as tunneling, autoconfiguration of 
  addresses, mobile IP, etc., are not supported at the Java API level, as they 
  are handled automatically by the underlying OS or system support.</p>
<h2><a name="supported"></a>Supported Operating Systems</h2>
<p>The following operating systems are supported in this release:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Solaris 8 and up</li>
  <li>Linux kernel 2.1.2 and up (RedHat 6.1 and up) </li>
</ul>
<h4>Notes on Linux</h4>
<ol>
  <li><font size="+1"></font>It is recommended to use Linux kernel 2.4.0 and higher 
    releases, as IPv6 support is better in those releases.</li>
  <li>With Linux, you need to install an IPv6-enabled kernel or rebuild the kernel 
    with IPv6 options enabled. (Up until Kernel 2.4.2, the IPv6 implementation 
    is marked as &quot;experimental.&quot;) In addition, you will need to install 
    several network utilities. For detailed information, refer to <a href="http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/IPv6-HOWTO/IPv6-HOWTO.html">http://www.bieringer.de/linux/IPv6/IPv6-HOWTO/IPv6-HOWTO.html</a></li>
</ol>
<h4>Notes on Windows</h4>
<p>J2SE<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> 1.4 does not support IPv6 
on Microsoft Windows. Microsoft has
released an IPv6 Technology Previous for Windows 2000 but this
is a limited seperate stack implementation. A complete dual 
IPv4/IPv6 stack implementation for Microsoft Windows is not expected 
to be released until 2002 or later.</p>
<h2><a name="special"></a>Special IPv6 Address Types </h2>
<h4>Unspecified address (:: corresponding to 0.0.0.0 in IPv4)</h4>
<p>This is also called <i>anylocal</i> or <i>wildcard</i> address. If a socket 
  is bound to an IPv6 anylocal address on a dual-stack machine, it can accept 
  both IPv6 and IPv4 traffic; if it is bound to an IPv4 (IPv4-mapped) anylocal 
  address, it can only accept IPv4 traffic. We always try to bind to IPv6 anylocal 
  address on a dual-stack machine unless a related system property is set to use 
  IPv4 Stack.</p>
<p>When bound to <code>::</code>, method <a href="../../../api/java/net/ServerSocket.html#accept()"><tt>ServerSocket.accept</tt></a> 
  will accept connections from both IPv6 or IPv4 hosts. The Java platform API 
  currently has no way to specify to accept connections only from IPv6 hosts.</p>
<p> Applications can enumerate the interfaces using <a href="../../../api/java/net/NetworkInterface.html"><tt>NetworkInterface</tt></a> 
  and bind a <a href="../../../api/java/nio/channels/ServerSocketChannel.html"><tt>ServerSocketChannel</tt></a> 
  to each IPv6 address, and then use a selector from the <a href="../../../api/java/nio/package-summary.html">New 
  I/O API</a> to accept connections from these sockets. </p>
<table summary="layout" width="80%" border="0" cellpadding="5" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p align="left"><b><font size="+1">Note:</font></b> The option discussed 
        below is introduced in Draft-ietf-ipngwg-rfc2553bis-03.txt. It will be 
        supported in the Java 2 platform when it becomes a standard.</p>
      </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>However, there is a new socket option that changes the above behaviour. Draft-ietf-ipngwg-rfc2553bis-03.txt 
  has introduced a new IP level socket option, IPV6_V6ONLY. This socket option 
  restricts AF_INET6 sockets to IPv6 communications only. Normally, AF_INET6 sockets 
  may be used for both IPv4 and IPv6 communications. Some applications may want 
  to restrict their use of an AF_INET6 socket to IPv6 communications only. For 
  these applications the IPV6_V6ONLY socket option is defined. When this option 
  is turned on, the socket can be used to send and receive IPv6 packets only. 
  By default this option is turned off.</p>
<h4>Loopback address (::1 corresponding to 127.0.0.1 in IPv4)</h4>
<p>Packets with the loopback address must never be sent on a link or forwarded 
  by an IPv6 router. There are two separate loopback addresses for IPv4 and IPv6 
  and they are treated as such.</p>
<p>IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are separate address spaces except when it comes to 
  &quot;::&quot;.</p>
<h4>Compatibility address ::w.x.y.z</h4>
<p>This is used for hosts and routers to dynamically tunnel IPv6 packets over 
  IPv4 routing infrastructure. It is meaningful for OS kernel and routers. Java 
  provides a utility method to test it.</p>
<h4>IPv4-mapped address ::ffff:w.x.y.z</h4>
<p>This is an IPv6 address that is used to represent an IPv4 address. It allows 
  the native program to use the same address data structure and also the same 
  socket when communicating with both IPv4 and IPv6 nodes. Thus, on a dual-stack 
  node with IPv4-mapped address support, an IPv6 application can talk to both 
  IPv4 and IPv6 peer. The OS will do the underlying plumbing required to send 
  or receive an IPv4 datagram and to hand it to an IPv6 destination socket, and 
  it will synthesize an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address when needed.</p>
<p>For Java, it is used for internal representation; it has no functional role. 
  Java will never return an IPv4-mapped address. It understands IPv4-mapped address 
  syntax, both in byte array and text representation. However, it will be converted 
  into an IPv4 address.</p>
<h2><a name="ipv6-related"></a>IPv6-Related System Properties</h2>
<p>On dual stack machines, system properties are provided for setting the preferred 
  protocol stack&#151;IPv4 or IPv6&#151;as well as the preferred<br>
  address family types&#151;inet4 or inet6.</p>
<p>IPv6 stack is preferred by default, since on a dual-stack machine IPv6 socket 
  can talk to both IPv4 and IPv6 peers. </p>
<p>This setting can be changed through the <code>java.net.preferIPv4Stack=&lt;true|false&gt;</code> 
  system property.</p>
<p>By default, we would prefer IPv4 addresses over IPv6 addresses, i.e., when 
  querying the name service (e.g., DNS service), we would return Ipv4 addresses 
  ahead of IPv6 addresses. There are two reasons for this choice: </p>
<ol>
  <li>There are some applications that expect an IPv4 address textual format, 
    i.e. &quot;%d.%d.%d.%d&quot;. Using an IPv4 address minimizes the surprises; 
  </li>
  <li>Using IPv4 address, we can use one call (with an IPv6 socket) to reach either 
    a legacy IPv4-only service, or an IPv6 service (unless the IPv6 service is 
    on a Ipv6 only node).</li>
</ol>
<p>This setting can be changed through the system property <code>java.net.preferIPv6Addresses=&lt;true|false&gt;</code></p>

<h2><a name="dual"></a>Dual-Stack Node</h2>
<p>For many years, if not forever, there will be a mix of IPv6 and IPv4 nodes 
  on the Internet. Thus compatibility with the large installed base of IPv4 nodes 
  is crucial for the success of the transition from IPv4 to IPv6. Dual stack, 
  defined in RFC 1933, is one of the main mechanisms for guaranteeing a smooth 
  transition. The other mechanism is IPv6 packet tunneling, which is relevant 
  to the J2SDK only through the IPv4-compatible address. The former is the most 
  relevant piece to the J2SDK. A dual stack includes implementations of both versions 
  of the Internet Protocol, IPv4 and IPv6.</p>
<p>A general property of a dual-stack node is that an IPv6 socket can communicate 
  both with an IPv4 and IPv6 peer at the transport layer (TCP or UDP) . At the 
  native level, the IPv6 socket communicates with an IPv4 peer through an IPv4-mapped 
  IPv6 address. However, unless a socket checks for the peers address type, it 
  won't know whether it is talking to an IPv4 or an IPv6 peer. All the internal 
  plumbing and conversion of address types is done by the dual-protocol stack.</p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>Note:</b></font> IPv4-mapped address has significance only 
  at the implementation of a dual-protocol stack. It is used to <i>fake</i> (i.e., 
  appear in the same format as) an Ipv6 address to be handed over to an IPv6 socket. 
  At the conceptual level it has no role; its role is limited at the Java API 
  level. Parsing of an IPv4-mapped address is supported, but an IPv4-mapped address 
  is never returned.</p>
<p><!--An example follows:

(needs to be fille in) --></p>
<h2><a name="java"></a>Java Application Impact</h2>
<ol>
  <li>There should be no change in Java application code if everything has been 
    done appropriately. I.e., there are no direct references to IPv4 literal addresses; 
    instead, hostnames are used.</li>
  <li>All the address or socket type information is encapsulated in the Java networking 
    API.</li>
  <li>Through setting system properties, address type and/or socket type preferences 
    can be set. </li>
  <li>For new applications Ipv6-specific new classes and APIs can be used.</li>
</ol>

<h4>UDP<br>
  scenario 1:</h4>
<p>Either host1 or host2 can be a native application. </p>
<h4>host1 is server, host2 is client</h4>
<p>If host2 wants to talk to host1, it will create a V6 socket. It then looks 
  up the IP address for host1. Since host1 only has a v4 protocol stack, it will 
  only have IPv4 records in the name lookup service. So host2 will try to reach 
  host1 using an IPv4-mapped address. An IPv4 packet will be sent by host2, and 
  host1 will think it is communicating with a v4 client.</p>
<h4>host1 is client, host2 is server</h4>
<p>If host2 is the server, it will first create a v6-type socket (by default), 
  then it will wait for connections. Since host1 supports v4 only, it creates 
  a v4-type socket. They resolves the name for host2. It only gets v4 address 
  for host2, since it doesn't understand IPv6 address. So it connects to host2 
  using v4 address. A v4 packet will be sent on the wire. On host2, the dual stack 
  will convert the v4 packet into a v6 packet with a v4-mapped address in it and 
  hand it over to the v6 socket. The server application will handle it as if it 
  is a connection from a v6 node.</p>

scenario 3: Java v4/v6 and v6

(coming soon) --></p>
<h2><a name="class"></a>Class Changes</h2>
<h4><code>InetAddress</code></h4>
<p>This class represents an IP address. It provides address storage, name-address 
  translation methods, address conversion methods, as well as address testing 
  methods. In J2SE 1.4, this class is extended to support both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. 
  Utility methods are added to check address types and scopes. The two types of 
  addresses, IPv4 and IPv6, can be distinguished by the Java type <code>Inet4Address</code> 
  and <code>Inet6Address</code>.</p>
<p>Two new subclasses of <code>InetAddress</code> are created: <code>Inet4Address</code> 
  and <code>Inet6Address</code>. V4- and V6-specific state and behaviors are implemented 
  in these two subclasses. Due to Java's object-oriented nature, an application 
  normally only needs to deal with <code>InetAddress</code> class&#151;through 
  polymorphism it will get the correct behavior. Only when it needs to access 
  protocol-family-specific behaviors, such as in calling an IPv6-only method, 
  or when it cares to know the class types of the IP address, will it ever become 
  aware of <code>Inet4Address</code> and <code>Inet6Address</code>.</p>
<p>The new methods introduced are:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>InetAddress:<br>
    isAnyLocalAddress<br>
    isLoopbackAddress<br>
    isLinkLocalAddress<br>
    isSiteLocalAddress<br>
    isMCGlobal<br>
    isMCNodeLocal<br>
    isMCLinkLocal<br>
    isMCSiteLocal<br>
    isMCOrgLocal<br>
    getCanonicalHostName<br>
    getByAddr</code></p>
</blockquote>
<h4><code>Inet6Address:<br>
  isIPv4CompatibleAddress</code></h4>
<p><!--(need to say something here) --></p>
<h4><code>InetAddress</code> and Different Naming services</h4>
<p>Prior to 1.4, <code>InetAddress</code> utilized the system configured name 
  service to resolve host names. In 1.4, we have added a Java DNS provider through 
  JNDI for alternative name lookups. You can tell the J2SDK to use this provider 
  by setting up a few system properties. These system properties are documented 
  in the Java system properties section. In the future, we plan to provide a generic 
  service provider framework so that you can write your own name service providers. 
</p>
<h4>A Word on Serialization</h4>
<p>All IPv4 addresses are represented in Java as <code>Inet4Address</code> objects. 
  They are serialized as <code>InetAddress</code> objects, and deserialized from 
  <code>InetAddress</code> to <code>Inet4Address</code> to keep backward compatibility. 
  IPv6 addresses are represented as <code>Inet6Address</code> and are serialized 
  as such.</p>
<h4><code>Socket</code>, <code>ServerSocket</code>, and <code>DatagramSocket</code></h4>
<p>Due to the object-oriented nature of Java, the address types and storage structures 
  are not exposed at the socket API level, so no new APIs are needed. The existing 
  socket APIs handle both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.</p>
<p>The selection of which stack to use depends upon the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The underlying OS support; </li>
  <li>The user's stack preference property setting.</li>
</ol>
<p>All supported Ipv6 socket options have a IPv4 counterparts. Thus no new APIs 
  were added to support IPv6 socket options. Instead, the old APIs are overloaded 
  to support both V4 and V6 socket options.</p>
<h4><code>MulticastSocket</code> </h4>
<p>Again all the socket options APIs are overloaded to support IPv6 multicast 
  socket options. </p>
<p>We have added two new APIs to set/get network interfaces in addition to the 
  existing <code>MulticastSocket.setInterface</code>/<code>MulticastSocket.getInterface</code> 
  that takes/returns an <code>InetAddress</code> instance. The two existing methods 
  are used to set or retrieve the network interface used by the current <code>MulticastSocket</code> 
  to send multicast packets (i.e., equivalent to <code>IP_MULTICAST_IF</code> 
  in native socket option). For IPv4, the interface was indicated by an IP address. 
  Thus we can use the equivalent <code>InetAddress</code> in Java. They will continue 
  to work with IPv6 multicast socket. However, in IPv6, according to RFC 2553, 
  the interface should be indicated using an interface index. To better support 
  the concept of a network interface, we introduced a new class, <code>NetworkInterface</code>. 
  It encapsulate the data representing the state of the network interface, including 
  name and IP addresses and some basic manipulation methods. Thus we have introduced 
  two new methods for setting the outgoing interface for multicast socket: <code>setNetworkInterface</code> 
  and <code>getNetworkInterface</code>. They take or return a <code>NetworkInterface</code> 
  object. These new methods can be used with both v4 and v6 multicast. </p>
<p>Methods have also been added for joining and leaving a multicast group on a 
  network interface. This was previously unavailable in the Java API.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>MulticastSocket:<br>
    NetworkInterface getNetworkInterface()<br>
    setNetworkInterface(NetworkInterface netIf)<br>
    joinGroup(SocketAddress mcastaddr,NetworkInterface netIf)<br>
    leaveGroup(SocketAddress mcastaddr,NetworkInterface netIf)</code></p>
</blockquote>
<h4><code>URL</code>, <code>URI</code> parsers</h4>
<p>Literal IP addresses can be used in URL/URIs. However, since colon (<code>:</code>) 
  is used in existing URL/URI specifications to separate host from port, using 
  literal IPv6 representation in URL/URIs without modification will fail in parsing. 
  Thus for specifying literal IPv6 addresses in URL/URIs, RFC 2732 was created. 
  The parsing of URL/URI has been updated to be compliant with RFC 2732.</p>
<h4>SocketPermission</h4>
<p>Since <code>SocketPermission</code> utilizes URLs, its implementation has been 
  updated to be compliant with RFC 2732.</p>
<p><code>codebase</code>, used in defining a permission, is a variant of URL. 
  As such, it should follow URL formats and conventions. RFC 2732 format is used 
  for URL and <code>codebase</code>; RFC 2373 format is used everywhere else. 
</p>
<h2><a name="ipv6-networking"></a>IPv6 Networking Properties<br>
</h2>
<h3><code>java.net.preferIPv4Stack (default: false)</code></h3>
<p>If IPv6 is available on the operating system, the underlying native socket 
  will be an IPv6 socket. This allows Java(tm) applications to connect too, and 
  accept connections from, both IPv4 andIPv6 hosts.</p>
<p>If an application has a preference to only use IPv4 sockets, then this property 
  can be set to true. The implication is that the application will not be able 
  to communicate with IPv6 hosts.</p>
<h3><code>java.net.preferIPv6Addresses (default: false)</code></h3>
<p>If IPv6 is available on the operating system, the default preference is to 
  prefer an IPv4-mapped address over an IPv6 address. This is for backward compatibility 
  reasons&#151;for example, applications that depend on access to an IPv4-only 
  service, or applications that depend on the %d.%d.%d.%d representation of an 
  IP address.<br>
  This property can be set to try to change the preferences to use IPv6 addresses 
  over IPv4 addresses. This allows applications to be tested and deployed in environments 
  where the application is expected to connect to IPv6 services.</p>
<h3>JNDI DNS service provider settings:</h3>
<h3><code>sun.net.spi.nameservice.provider.&lt;n&gt;=&lt;default|dns,sun|...&gt;</code></h3>
<p>Specifies the name service provider that you can use. By default, Java will 
  use the system-configured, name-lookup mechanism, such as file, nis, etc. You 
  can specify your own by setting this option. <code>&lt;n&gt;</code> takes the 
  value of a positive number and it indicates the precedence order: a small number 
  takes higher precendence over a bigger number. In 1.4 , we have provided one 
  DNS name service provider through JNDI, which is called <code>dns,sun</code>.</p>
<h3><code>sun.net.spi.nameservice.nameservers=&lt;server1_ipaddr,server2_ipaddr 
  ...&gt;</code></h3>
<p>You can specify a comma separated list of IP addresses that point to the DNS 
  servers you want to use.</p>
<h3><code>sun.net.spi.nameservice.domain=&lt;domainname&gt;</code></h3>
<p>This property specifies the default DNS domain name, e.g., <code>eng.sun.com</code>.</p>
