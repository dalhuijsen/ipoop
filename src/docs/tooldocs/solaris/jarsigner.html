<H1>jarsigner - JAR Signing and Verification Tool</H1>
<blockquote>
Generates signatures for Java ARchive (JAR) files, and verifies
the signatures of signed JAR files.
</blockquote>

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<strong>jarsigner</strong> [ <a href="#Options">options</a> ] jar-file alias
<strong>jarsigner</strong> -verify [ <a href="#Options">options</a> ] jar-file 
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<blockquote>

The <b>jarsigner</b> tool is used for two purposes:

<ol>

<li>to sign Java ARchive (JAR) files, and<p>

<li>to verify the signatures and integrity of signed JAR files.

</ol>

<p>The JAR feature 
enables the packaging of class files, images, sounds, and other digital data 
in a single file for faster and easier distribution. A tool
named <a href="jar.html"><b>jar</b></a> enables developers to 
produce JAR files. (Technically, any zip file can also be considered
a JAR file, although when created by <b>jar</b> or processed by 
<b>jarsigner</b>, JAR files also contain a META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file.)

<p>A <i>digital signature</i> is a string of bits that is computed from some data 
(the data being "signed") and the private key of an entity 
(a person, company, etc.).  
Like a handwritten signature, a digital signature 
has many useful characteristics:<p>

<ul>

<li>Its authenticity can be verified, via a computation that
uses the public key corresponding to the private key used to
generate the signature.<p>

<li>It cannot be forged, assuming the private key is kept secret.<p>

<li>It is a function of the data signed and thus can't be 
claimed to be the signature for other data as well.<p>

<li>The signed data cannot be changed; if it is, the signature
will no longer verify as being authentic.<p>

</ul>

<p>In order for an entity's signature to be generated for a file, 
the entity must first have 
a public/private key pair associated with it, 
and also one or more certificates authenticating its public key.
A <i>certificate</i> is a digitally signed statement
from one entity, saying that the public key of some other entity has a 
particular value. 

<p><b>jarsigner</b> uses key and certificate information from a 
<i>keystore</i> to generate digital signatures for JAR files. A keystore
is a database of private keys and their 
associated X.509 certificate
chains authenticating the corresponding public keys.
The <a href="keytool.html"><b>keytool</b></a> utility is used to
create and administer keystores. 

<p><b>jarsigner</b> uses an entity's private key to generate a signature.
The signed JAR file contains, among other things, a copy of the certificate 
from the keystore for the
public key corresponding to the private key used to sign the file.
<b>jarsigner</b> can verify the digital signature of the signed JAR file
using the certificate inside it (in its signature block file).

<p>At this time, <b>jarsigner</b> can only sign JAR files created by the
SDK <a href="jar.html"><b>jar</b></a> tool or zip files. (JAR files
are the same as zip files, except they also have a
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file. Such a file will automatically be created 
when <b>jarsigner</b> signs a zip file.)

<p>The default <b>jarsigner</b> behavior is to <i>sign</i> a JAR (or zip) 
file. Use the <code>-verify</code> option to instead have it 
<i>verify</i> a signed JAR file.



<h3>Compatibility with JDK 1.1</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>The <b>keytool</b> and <b>jarsigner</b> tools
completely replace the <b>javakey</b> tool provided in JDK 1.1.
These new tools provide more features than <b>javakey</b>,
including the ability to protect the keystore and private keys
with passwords, and the ability to verify signatures in addition
to generating them. 

<p>The new keystore architecture replaces the identity database that 
<b>javakey</b> created and managed. There is no backwards compatibility 
between the keystore format and the database format used by <b>javakey</b> 
in 1.1. However, 

<ul>

<li>It is possible to import the information from
an identity database into a keystore, via the <b>keytool</b> 
<code>-identitydb</code> command.<p>

<li><b>jarsigner</b> can sign JAR files also previously signed using 
<b>javakey</b>.<p>

<li><b>jarsigner</b> can verify JAR files signed using <b>javakey</b>.
Thus, it recognizes and can work with signer aliases that are from a 
JDK 1.1 identity database rather than a Java 2 SDK keystore.

</ul>

The following table explains how JAR files that were signed
in JDK 1.1.x are treated in the Java 2 platform.

<h3>Keystore Aliases</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>All keystore entities are accessed via unique <i>aliases</i>.

<p>When using <b>jarsigner</b> to sign a JAR file, you must specify the
alias for the keystore entry containing the private key needed
to generate the signature. For example, the following will
sign the JAR file named "MyJARFile.jar", using the private key
associated with the alias "duke" in the keystore named
"mystore" in the "working" directory. Since no output file is
specified, it overwrites MyJARFile.jar with the signed JAR
file.

<pre>
    jarsigner -keystore /working/mystore -storepass myspass
      -keypass dukekeypasswd MyJARFile.jar duke 
</pre>
 
<p>Keystores are protected with a password, so the store password
(in this case "myspass") must be specified. You will
be prompted for it if you don't specify it on the command line.
Similarly, private keys are protected
in a keystore with a password, so the private key's password
(in this case "dukekeypasswd") must be specified, and you will
be prompted for it if you don't specify it on the command line
and it isn't the same as the store password.

</blockquote>


<h3>Keystore Location</h3>

<blockquote>

<b>jarsigner</b> has a <code>-keystore</code> option for 
specifying the URL of the keystore to be used.
The keystore is by default stored in a file 
named <i>.keystore</i> in the user's home directory, as determined by the 
"user.home" system property. On Solaris systems "user.home" defaults
to the user's home directory.

</blockquote>


<H3><a name=KeystoreImplementation>Keystore Implementation</a></H3>

<blockquote>

The <code>KeyStore</code> class provided in the 
<code>java.security</code> package supplies
well-defined interfaces to access and modify the information
in a keystore. It is possible for there to be
multiple different concrete implementations, where each 
implementation is that for a particular <i>type</i> of keystore.

<p>Currently, there are two command-line tools that make use of 
keystore implementations (<b>keytool</b> and <b>jarsigner</b>),
and also a GUI-based tool named <b>Policy Tool</b>.
Since <code>KeyStore</code> is publicly available, Java 2 SDK users can 
write additional security applications that use it.

<p>There is a built-in default implementation, provided by 
Sun Microsystems. It implements the keystore as a file, utilizing
a proprietary keystore type (format) named "JKS". 
It protects each private key with its individual password, and also protects 
the integrity of the entire keystore with a
(possibly different) password.

<p>Keystore implementations are provider-based. More specifically, 
the application interfaces supplied by <code>KeyStore</code> are
implemented in terms of a "Service Provider Interface" (SPI).
That is, there is a corresponding abstract <code>KeystoreSpi</code> class, 
also in the <code>java.security</code> package, which defines the Service 
Provider Interface methods that "providers" must implement.
(The term "provider" refers to a package or a set of packages that supply
a concrete implementation of a subset of services that can be accessed
by the Java Security API.)
Thus, to provide a keystore implementation, clients must implement a
provider and supply a KeystoreSpi subclass implementation, as described in
<a href="../../guide/security/HowToImplAProvider.html">How to Implement a 
Provider for the Java Cryptography Architecture</a>.

<p>Applications can choose different <i>types</i> of keystore implementations
from different providers, using the "getInstance" factory method supplied
in the <code>KeyStore</code> class.
A keystore type defines the storage and data format of the keystore
information, and the algorithms used to
protect private keys in the keystore and the integrity of the keystore
itself. Keystore implementations of different types are not compatible. 

<p><b>keytool</b> works on any file-based keystore
implementation. (It treats the keytore location that is passed to
it at the command line as a filename and converts it to a
FileInputStream, from which it loads the keystore information.)
The <b>jarsigner</b> and <b>policytool</b> tools, on the other hand, 
can read a keystore from any location that can be specified
using a URL.

<p>For <b>jarsigner</b> and <b>keytool</b>, you can specify a keystore
type at the command line, via the <i>-storetype</i> option. For
<b>Policy Tool</b>, you can specify a keystore type via the "Change Keystore"
command in the Edit menu.

<p>If you don't explicitly specify a keystore type,
the tools choose a keystore implementation based simply on 
the value of the <code>keystore.type</code>
property specified in the security properties file. 
The security properties file is called <tt>java.security</tt>, and 
it resides in the SDK security properties directory,  
<code><i>java.home</i>/lib/security</code>, where <i>java.home</i> is 
the runtime environment's directory (the <tt>jre</tt> directory in the SDK 
or the top-level directory of the Java 2 Runtime Environment).

<p>Each tool gets the <code>keystore.type</code> value and then examines all 
the currently-installed providers until it finds one that implements 
keystores of that type. It then uses the keystore implementation
from that provider.

<p>The <code>KeyStore</code> class defines a static method named 
<code>getDefaultType</code> that lets applications and applets 
retrieve the value of the <code>keystore.type</code> property.
The following line of code creates an instance of the default
keystore type (as specified in the <code>keystore.type</code> property):

<pre>
    KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());
</pre>

<p>The default keystore type is "jks" (the proprietary type of the
keystore implementation provided by Sun). This is specified by
the following line in the security properties file:

<pre>
    keystore.type=jks
</pre>

<p>To have the tools utilize a keystore implementation other 
than the default, change that line to specify a different keystore type.

<p>For example, if you have a provider package that supplies a
keystore implementation for a keystore type called "pkcs12",
change the line to

<pre>
    keystore.type=pkcs12
</pre>

Note: case doesn't matter in keystore type designations. For example,
"JKS" would be considered the same as "jks".

</blockquote>


<h3><a name=DefaultAlgs>Supported Algorithms</a></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>At this time, <b>jarsigner</b> can sign a JAR file using either 

<ul>

<li>DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) with the SHA-1 digest algorithm, or<p>

<li>the RSA algorithm with the MD5 digest algorithm.

</ul>

<p>That is, if the signer's public and private keys are DSA keys, 
<b>jarsigner</b> will sign the JAR file using the "SHA1withDSA" algorithm.
If the signer's keys are 
RSA keys, <b>jarsigner</b> will attempt to sign the JAR file 
using the "MD5withRSA" algorithm. This is only possible if
there is a statically installed <a 
href="../../guide/security/CryptoSpec.html#Provider">provider</a> 
supplying an implementation for the "MD5withRSA" algorithm. (There is
always a "SHA1withDSA" algorithm available, 
from the default "SUN" provider.)

</blockquote>

<h3><a name=DefaultAlgs>The Signed JAR File</a></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>When <b>jarsigner</b> is used to sign a JAR file, the output
signed JAR file is exactly the same as the input JAR file,
except that it has two additional files placed in the
META-INF directory:

<ul>

<li>a signature file, with a .SF extension, and<p>

<li>a signature block file, with a .DSA extension.

</ul>

The base file names for these two files come from the value of 
the <code>-sigFile</code> option. For example, if the option
appears as

<pre>
  -sigFile MKSIGN
</pre>

the files are named "MKSIGN.SF" and "MKSIGN.DSA".

<p>If no <code>-sigfile</code> option appears on the command
line, the base file name for the .SF and .DSA files will
be the first 8 characters of the alias name specified
on the command line, all converted to upper case.
If the alias name has fewer than 8 characters, the
full alias name is used. If the alias name contains any
characters that are not allowed in a signature file name,
each such character is converted to an underscore ("_")
character in forming the file name. Legal characters
include letters, digits, underscores, and hyphens.

<H4><a name="SFFile">The Signature (.SF) File</a></H4>

<blockquote>

A signature file (the .SF file) looks similar to the manifest file
that is always included in a JAR file when <b>jarsigner</b> is
used to sign the file.
That is, for each source file included in the JAR file, the .SF file has
three lines, just as in the manifest file, listing the following:

<ul>

<li>the file name,<p>

<li>the name of the digest algorithm used (SHA), and <p>

<li>a SHA digest value.

</ul>

In the manifest file, the SHA digest value for each source file is
the digest (hash) of the binary data in the source file. In the
.SF file, on the other hand, the digest value for a given source file
is the hash of the three lines in the manifest file for the source file.

<p>The signature file also, by default, includes a header containing a 
hash of the whole manifest file. The presence of the header enables 
verification optimization, as described in <a href = "#Verifying">
JAR File Verification</a>.

</blockquote>


<H4>The Signature Block (.DSA) File</H4>

<blockquote>

The .SF file is signed and the signature is placed in the .DSA file.
The .DSA file also contains, encoded inside it, the certificate 
or certificate chain from the keystore which
authenticates the public key corresponding to the private key used 
for signing.

</blockquote>

</blockquote>


<H3><a name="Verifying">JAR File Verification</a></H3>

<blockquote>

<p>A successful JAR file verification occurs if the signature(s) 
are valid, and none of the files that were in the JAR file when
the signatures were generated have been changed since then. 

JAR file verification involves the following steps:

<ol>

<li>Verify the signature of the .SF file itself.

<p>That is, the verification ensures that the signature stored in each 
signature block (.DSA) file was in fact generated using the private key 
corresponding to the public key whose certificate (or certificate
chain) also appears in
the .DSA file. It also ensures that the signature is a valid
signature of the corresponding signature (.SF) file, and thus
the .SF file has not been tampered with.<p>

<li>Verify the digest listed in each entry in the .SF file with
each corresponding section in the manifest.

<p>The .SF file by default includes a header containing a hash of 
the entire manifest file. When the header is present, then the verification 
can check to see whether or not the hash in the header indeed matches 
the hash of the manifest file. If that is the case, verification proceeds
to the next step.

<p>If that is not the case, a less optimized
verification is required to ensure that the hash 
in each source file information section in the .SF file equals the 
hash of its corresponding section in the manifest file (see 
<a href = "#SFFile">The Signature (.SF) File</a>). 

<p>One reason the hash of the manifest file that is stored in
the .SF file header may not equal the hash of the current manifest
file would be because one or more files were added to the JAR file
(using the <code>jar</code> tool) after the signature (and thus the 
.SF file) was generated. When the <code>jar</code> tool is used to add
files, the manifest file is changed (sections are added to
it for the new files), but the .SF file is not. A
verification is still considered successful if none of the files 
that were in the JAR file when the signature was generated 
have been changed since then, which is the case if the hashes in
the non-header sections of the .SF file equal the hashes of the
corresponding sections in the manifest file.<p>

<li>Read each file in the JAR file that has an entry in the .SF file.
While reading, compute the file's digest, and
then compare the result with the digest for this file in the
manifest section. The digests should be the same, or verification fails.

</ol>

<p>If any serious verification failures occur during the verification
process, the process is stopped and a security exception is thrown.
It is caught and displayed by <b>jarsigner</b>.


</blockquote>

<H3>Multiple Signatures for a JAR File</H3>

<blockquote>

A JAR file can be signed by multiple people simply by running the
<b>jarsigner</b> tool on the file multiple times, specifying the alias 
for a different person each time, as in:

<pre>
  jarsigner myBundle.jar susan
  jarsigner myBundle.jar kevin
</pre>

When a JAR file is signed multiple times, there are multiple .SF and 
.DSA files in the resulting JAR file, one pair for each signature.
Thus, in the example above, the output JAR file includes files with
the following names:

<pre>
  SUSAN.SF
  SUSAN.DSA
  KEVIN.SF
  KEVIN.DSA
</pre>

Note: It is also possible for a JAR file to have mixed signatures,
some generated by the JDK 1.1 <b>javakey</b> tool and others by 
<b>jarsigner</b>. That is, <b>jarsigner</b> can be used to sign 
JAR files already previously signed using <b>javakey</b>.

</blockquote>


</blockquote>


<h2><a name=Options>OPTIONS</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>The various <b>jarsigner</b> options are listed and described 
below. Note: 

<ul>

<li>All option names are preceded by a minus sign (-).<p>

<li>The options may be provided in any order.<p>

<li>Items in italics (option values) represent the actual values
that must be supplied.<p> 

<li>The <code>-keystore</code>, <code>-storepass</code>, <code>-keypass</code>,
<code>-sigfile</code> , and <code>-signedjar</code> options are only relevant when 
signing a JAR file, not when verifying a signed
JAR file. Similarly, an alias is only specified on the command line
when signing a JAR file.

</ul>

<p>

<dl>

<dt><b><code>-keystore </code></b><i>url</i>
<dd>
Specifies the URL that tells the keystore location. 
This defaults to the file
<i>.keystore</i> in the user's home directory, as determined by the 
"user.home" system property.

<p>A keystore is required when signing, so you must explicitly specify
one if the default keystore does not exist (or you want to use one
other than the default).

<p>A keystore is <i>not</i> required when verifying, but if one is specified,
or the default exists, and the <code>-verbose</code> option was also
specified, additional information is output
regarding whether or not any of the
certificates used to verify the JAR file are contained in that
keystore.

<p>Note: the <code>-keystore</code> argument can actually be a file name 
(and path) specification rather than a URL, in which case it will be treated
the same as a "file:" URL. That is,

<pre>
  -keystore <i>filePathAndName</i>
</pre>

is treated as equivalent to

<pre>
  -keystore file:<i>filePathAndName</i>
</pre>

<p>

<dt><b><code>-storetype </code></b><i>storetype</i>
<dd>
Specifies the type of keystore to be instantiated. The 
default keystore type is the one that is specified as the value of the
"keystore.type" property in the security properties file, which is
returned by the static <code>getDefaultType</code> method in
<code>java.security.KeyStore</code>.
<p>

<dt><b><code>-storepass </code></b><i>password</i>
<dd>
Specifies the password which is required to access the
keystore. This is only needed when
signing (not verifying) a JAR file. In that case,
if a <code>-storepass</code> option
is not provided at the command 
line, the user is prompted for the password.

<p>Note: The password shouldn't be specified on the command line or in a 
script unless it is for testing purposes, or you are on a secure
system. Also, when typing in a password at the password prompt, 
the password is echoed (displayed exactly as typed),
so be careful not to type it in front of anyone.
<p>

<dt><b><code>-keypass </code></b><i>password</i>
<dd>
Specifies the password used to protect the
private key of the keystore entry addressed by the alias
specified on the command line. The password is required when
using <b>jarsigner</b> to sign a JAR file. If no password is provided on
the command line, and the required password is different from 
the store password, the user is prompted for it.

<p>Note: The password shouldn't be specified on the command line or in a 
script unless it is for testing purposes, or you are on a secure
system. Also, when typing in a password at the password prompt, 
the password is echoed (displayed exactly as typed),
so be careful not to type it in front of anyone.
<p>

<dt><b><code>-sigfile </code></b><i>file</i>
<dd>
Specifies the base file name to be used for the generated
.SF and .DSA files. For example, if <i>file</i> is
"DUKESIGN", the generated .SF and .DSA files will be
named "DUKESIGN.SF" and "DUKESIGN.DSA", and will be
placed in the "META-INF" directory of the
signed JAR file.

<p>The characters in <i>file</i> must come from the set 
"a-zA-Z0-9_-". That is, only letters, numbers, underscore, and
hyphen characters are allowed. Note: All lowercase
characters will be converted to uppercase for the
.SF and .DSA file names.

<p>If no <code>-sigfile</code> option appears on the command
line, the base file name for the .SF and .DSA files will
be the first 8 characters of the alias name specified
on the command line, all converted to upper case.
If the alias name has fewer than 8 characters, the
full alias name is used.  If the alias name contains any
characters that are not legal in a signature file name,
each such character is converted to an underscore ("_")
character in forming the file name.
<p>

<dt><b><code>-signedjar </code></b><i>file</i>
<dd>
Specifies the name to be used for the signed JAR file.

<p>If no name is specified on the command line,
the name used is the same as the input JAR file name (the name
of the JAR file to be signed); 
in other words, that file is overwritten with the signed JAR file.
<p>

<dt><b><code>-verify </code></b>
<dd>
If this appears on the command line, the specified JAR
file will be verified, not signed. If the verification is
successful, "jar verified" will be displayed. 
If you try to verify an unsigned JAR file, or a JAR file signed with 
an unsupported algorithm (e.g., RSA when you don't have an RSA 
provider installed), the following is displayed:
"jar is unsigned. (signatures missing or not parsable)"

<p>It is possible to verify JAR files signed using either <b>jarsigner</b> 
or the JDK 1.1 <b>javakey</b> tool, or both.

<p>For further information on verification,
see <a href = "#Verifying">JAR File Verification</a>.
<p>

<dt><b><code>-certs </code></b>
<dd>
If this appears on the command line, along with the <code>-verify</code> and
<code>-verbose</code> options, the output includes certificate information 
for each signer of the JAR file. This information includes<p>
<ul>
<li>the name of the type of certificate (stored in the .DSA file) that
certifies the signer's public key<p>
<li>if the certificate is an X.509 certificate (more specifically, an
instance of <code>java.security.cert.X509Certificate</code>): 
the distinguished name of the signer
</ul>

<p>The keystore is also examined.
If no keystore value is specified on the command line,
the default keystore file (if any) will be checked.
If the public key certificate for a signer matches an
entry in the keystore, then the following information will
also be displayed:<p>

<ul>
<li>in parentheses, the alias name for the
keystore entry for that signer. If the signer actually
comes from a JDK 1.1 identity database instead of from a keystore,
the alias name will appear in brackets instead of parentheses.
</ul>

<p>

<dt><b><code>-verbose </code></b>
<dd>
If this appears on the command line, it indicates "verbose" mode,
which causes <b>jarsigner</b> to output extra information as to the
progress of the JAR signing or verification.
<p>

<dt><b><code>-internalsf </code></b>
<dd>
In the past, the .DSA (signature block) file generated when a JAR 
file was signed used to include a complete encoded copy of the 
.SF file (signature file) also generated. This behavior has been 
changed. To reduce the overall size of the output JAR file, the 
.DSA file by default doesn't contain a copy of the .SF file 
anymore. But if <code>-internalsf</code> appears on the command 
line, the old behavior is utilized. <b>This option is mainly useful
for testing; in practice, it should not be used, since doing so 
eliminates a useful optimization.</b>
<p>

<dt><b><code>-sectionsonly</code></b>
<dd>
If this appears on the command line, the .SF file (signature file) 
generated when a JAR file is signed does <i>not</i> include a 
header containing a hash of the whole manifest file. It just 
contains information and hashes related to each individual source 
file included in the JAR file, as described in
<a href = "#SFFile">The Signature (.SF) File</a> . 

<p>By default, this header is added, as an optimization. When the 
header is present, then whenever the JAR file is verified, the 
verification can first check to see whether or not the hash in 
the header indeed matches the hash of the whole manifest file.
If so, verification proceeds to the next step. If not, it is necessary to 
do a less optimized verification that the hash in each source file information 
section in the .SF file equals the hash of its corresponding 
section in the manifest file.

<p>For further information,
see <a href = "#Verifying">JAR File Verification</a>.
 
<p><b>This option is mainly useful for testing; in practice, it should 
not be used, since doing so eliminates a useful optimization.</b><p>

<dt><b><code>-provider</code></b> <i>provider-class-name</i>
<dd>Used to specify the name of cryptographic service provider's master 
class file when the service provider is not listed in the security 
properties file.<p>

<dt><b><code>-J</code></b><i>javaoption</i>
<dd>
Passes through the specified <i>javaoption</i> string directly to the Java interpreter. 
(<b>jarsigner</b> is actually a "wrapper" around the interpreter.)
This option should not contain any spaces. It is useful for adjusting
the execution environment or memory usage.
For a list of possible interpreter
options, type <code>java -h</code> or <code>java -X</code> at the command line.<p>

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<blockquote>

<H3>Signing a JAR File</H3>

<blockquote>

<p>Suppose you have a JAR file named "bundle.jar" and you'd like
to sign it using the private key of the user whose keystore alias
is "jane" in the keystore named "mystore" in the "working" directory.
Suppose the keystore password is "myspass" and the password for
<i>jane</i>'s private key is "j638klm". You can use the following to sign the
JAR file and name the signed JAR file "sbundle.jar":

<pre>
    jarsigner -keystore /working/mystore -storepass myspass
      -keypass j638klm -signedjar sbundle.jar bundle.jar jane 
</pre>
 
<p>Note that there is no <code>-sigfile</code> specified in the command 
above, so the generated .SF and .DSA files to be placed in the signed
JAR file will have default names based on the alias name. That is,
they will be named <code>JANE.SF</code> and <code>JANE.DSA</code>.

<p>If you want to be prompted for the store password and the private
key password, you could shorten the above command to

<pre>
    jarsigner -keystore /working/mystore
      -signedjar sbundle.jar bundle.jar jane 
</pre>
 
If the keystore to be used is the default keystore (the one named
".keystore" in your home directory), you don't need to specify a
keystore, as in:

<pre>
    jarsigner -signedjar sbundle.jar bundle.jar jane 
</pre>

Finally, if you want the signed JAR file to simply overwrite the
input JAR file (<code>bundle.jar</code>), you don't need to specify a
<code>-signedjar</code> option:

<pre>
    jarsigner bundle.jar jane 
</pre>

</blockquote>


<H3>Verifying a Signed JAR File</H3>

<blockquote>

To verify a signed JAR file, that is, to verify
that the signature is valid and the JAR file has not been tampered with,
use a command such as the following:

<pre>
    jarsigner -verify sbundle.jar 
</pre>
 
<p>If the verification is successful, 

<pre>
    jar verified.
</pre>

is displayed. Otherwise, an error message appears.

<p>You can get more information if you use the <code>-verbose</code> option. 
A sample use of <b>jarsigner</b> with the <code>-verbose</code> option is
shown below, along with sample output:

<pre>
    jarsigner -verify -verbose sbundle.jar

           198 Fri Sep 26 16:14:06 PDT 1997 META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
           199 Fri Sep 26 16:22:10 PDT 1997 META-INF/JANE.SF
          1013 Fri Sep 26 16:22:10 PDT 1997 META-INF/JANE.DSA
    smk   2752 Fri Sep 26 16:12:30 PDT 1997 AclEx.class
    smk    849 Fri Sep 26 16:12:46 PDT 1997 test.class

      s = signature was verified
      m = entry is listed in manifest
      k = at least one certificate was found in keystore

    jar verified.
</pre>



<H3>Verification with Certificate Information</H3>

If you specify the <code>-certs</code> option when verifying,
along with the <code>-verify</code> and
<code>-verbose</code> options, the output includes certificate information 
for each signer of the JAR file, including the certificate type,
the signer distinguished name information (iff it's an X.509 certificate),
and, in parentheses, the keystore alias for the signer
if the public key certificate in the JAR file matches that in a
keystore entry. For example,

<pre>
    jarsigner -keystore /working/mystore -verify -verbose -certs myTest.jar

           198 Fri Sep 26 16:14:06 PDT 1997 META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
           199 Fri Sep 26 16:22:10 PDT 1997 META-INF/JANE.SF
          1013 Fri Sep 26 16:22:10 PDT 1997 META-INF/JANE.DSA
           208 Fri Sep 26 16:23:30 PDT 1997 META-INF/JAVATEST.SF
          1087 Fri Sep 26 16:23:30 PDT 1997 META-INF/JAVATEST.DSA
    smk   2752 Fri Sep 26 16:12:30 PDT 1997 Tst.class

      X.509, CN=Test Group, OU=Java Software, O=Sun Microsystems, L=CUP, S=CA, C=US (javatest)
      X.509, CN=Jane Smith, OU=Java Software, O=Sun, L=cup, S=ca, C=us (jane)

      s = signature was verified
      m = entry is listed in manifest
      k = at least one certificate was found in keystore

    jar verified.
</pre>

If the certificate for a signer is not an X.509 certificate, there
is no distinguished name information. In that case, just the certificate
type and the alias are shown. For example, if the certificate is
a PGP certificate, and the alias is "bob", you'd get

<pre>
      PGP, (bob)
</pre>



<H3>Verification of a JAR File that Includes Identity Database Signers</H3>

If a JAR file has been signed using the JDK 1.1 <b>javakey</b>
tool, and thus the signer is an alias in an identity database,
the verification output includes an
"i" symbol. If the JAR file has been signed by both an
alias in an identity database and an alias in a keystore,
both "k" and "i" appear. 

<p>When the <code>-certs</code> option is used,
any identity database aliases are shown in square brackets
rather than the parentheses used for keystore aliases.
For example:

<pre>
    jarsigner -keystore /working/mystore -verify -verbose -certs writeFile.jar

           198 Fri Sep 26 16:14:06 PDT 1997 META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
           199 Fri Sep 26 16:22:10 PDT 1997 META-INF/JANE.SF
          1013 Fri Sep 26 16:22:10 PDT 1997 META-INF/JANE.DSA
           199 Fri Sep 27 12:22:30 PDT 1997 META-INF/DUKE.SF
          1013 Fri Sep 27 12:22:30 PDT 1997 META-INF/DUKE.DSA
   smki   2752 Fri Sep 26 16:12:30 PDT 1997 writeFile.html

      X.509, CN=Jane Smith, OU=Java Software, O=Sun, L=cup, S=ca, C=us (jane)
      X.509, CN=Duke, OU=Java Software, O=Sun, L=cup, S=ca, C=us [duke]

      s = signature was verified
      m = entry is listed in manifest
      k = at least one certificate was found in keystore
      i = at least one certificate was found in identity scope

    jar verified.
</pre>

Note that the alias "duke" is in brackets to denote that it is
an identity database alias, not a keystore alias.
