<h3>Java Properties</h3>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><b>java.net.preferIPv4Stack</b> (default: false)</dt>

<dd>If IPv6 is available on the operating system the underlying native
socket will be an IPv6 socket. This allows Java(tm) applications 
to connect too, and accept connections from, both IPv4 and
IPv6 hosts.
<p>
If an application has a preference to only use IPv4 sockets then
this property can be set to true. The implication is that the 
application will not be able to communicate with IPv6 hosts.
</dd>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<dt><b>java.net.preferIPv6Addresses</b> (default: false)</dt>

<dd>If IPv6 is available on the operating system the default 
preference is to prefer an IPv4-mapped address over an IPv6 address.
This is for backward compatibility reasons - for example
applications that depend on access to an IPv4 only service or applications
that depend on the %d.%d.%d.%d representation of an IP address.
This property can be set to try to change the preferences to use IPv6
addresses over IPv4 addresses. This allows applications to be tested
and deployed in environments where the application is expected to
connect to IPv6 services.
</dd>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<a name="nct">
<dt><b>networkaddress.cache.ttl</b> (default: -1)</dt>
</a>
<dd>Specified in java.security to indicate the caching policy for successful
name lookups from the name service.. The value is specified as as integer 
to indicate the number of seconds to cache the successful lookup.
<p>
A value of -1 indicates "cache forever".
</dt><p>
<hr>
<p>
<a name="ncnt">
<dt><b>networkaddress.cache.negative.ttl</b> (default: 10)</dt>
</a>
<dd>Specified in java.security to indicate the caching policy for un-successful
name lookups from the name service.. The value is specified as as integer 
to indicate the number of seconds to cache the failure for un-successful 
lookups.
<p>
A value of 0 indicates "never cache".
A value of -1 indicates "cache forever".
</dd>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<dt><b>http.proxyHost</b> (default: &lt;none&gt;)<br>
<b>http.proxyPort</b> (default: 80 if http.proxyHost specified)<br>
<b>http.nonProxyHosts</b> (default: &lt;none&gt;<br>
<p>
<b>ftp.proxyHost</b> (default: &lt;none&gt;)<br>
<b>ftp.proxyPort</b> (default: 80 if ftp.proxyHost specified)<br>
<b>ftp.nonProxyHosts</b> (default: &lt;none&gt;)</dt>

<dd>http.proxyHost and http.proxyPort indicate the proxy server and port that
the http protocol handler will use. 
<p>
http.nonProxyHosts indicates the hosts which should be connected too 
directly and not through the proxy server. The value can be a list
of hosts, each seperated by a |, and in addition a wildcard character
(*) can be used for matching. 
For example: -Dhttp.nonProxyHosts="*.foo.com|localhost". 
<p>
ftp.proxyHost and ftp.proxyPort indicate the proxy server and port that
the ftp protocol handler will use.  ftp.nonProxyHosts is similiar to
http.nonProxyHosts and indicates the hosts that should be connected too
directly and not through the proxy server.
</dd><p>
<hr>
<p>
<dt><b>http.agent</b> (default: Java1.4.0)</dt>
<p>
<dd>Indicates the User-Agent request header sent in http requests.</dd>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<dt><b>http.auth.digest.validateServer</b> (default: false)<br>
<b>http.auth.digest.validateProxy</b> (default: false)<br>
<b>http.auth.digest.cnonceRepeat</b> (default: 5)</dt>
<dd>
These system properties modify the behavior of the HTTP digest 
authentication mechanism. Digest authentication provides a limited 
ability for the server to authenticate
itself to the client (ie. by proving that it knows the users password). 
However, not all servers support this capability and by default the 
check is switched off.
The first two properties above can be set to true, to enforce this check, for
either authentication with an origin, or a proxy server respectively.
<p>
It is not normally necessary to set the third property 
(http.auth.digest.cnonceRepeat). This determines how many times a cnonce 
value is reused. This can be useful when the MD5-sess algorithm is 
being used. Increasing the value reduces the computational overhead on 
both the client and the server by reducing the amount of material that
has to be hashed for each HTTP request.
</dd>

<p>
<hr>
<dt><a name="ntlm"><b>http.auth.ntlm.domain:</b></dt>
<dd>
NTLM authentication is supported on Windows platforms only (due to licensing restrictions).
Similar to other HTTP authentication schemes, NTLM uses the java.net.Authenticator class
to acquire usernames and passwords when they are needed. However, NTLM also needs
the NT domain name. There are three options for specifying the domain:
<p>
<ol>
    <li>Do not specify it. In some environments, the domain is not actually required and
       the application need not specify it.</li>

    <li>The domain name can be encoded within the username by prefixing the domain name
       followed by a back-slash '\' before the username. With this method, existing applications
       that use the Authenticator class do not need to be modified, so long as users are made aware
       that this notation must be used.</li>

    <li>If a domain name is not specified as in method 2) and the system property "http.auth.ntlm.domain"
       is defined, then the value of this property will be used as the domain name.</li>
</ol>
<dd>

<p>
<hr>

<p>
<dt><b>http.keepAlive</b> (default: true)</dt>

<dd>Indicates if keep alive (persistent) connections should be supported.
Persistent connections improve performance by allowing the 
underlying socket connection be reused for multiple http 
requests. 
<p>
The default is true and thus persistent connections will be used
with http 1.1 servers. Set to 'false' to disable the use of
persistent connections.
</dd>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<dt><b>http.maxConnections</b> (default: 5)</dt>
<dd>If HTTP keep-alive is enabled, this value is the number
  of idle connections that will be simultaneously kept alive, per-destination.
<p>
<hr>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<a name="socks"><h3>SOCKS protocol support settings</h3></a>
<blockquote>
The SOCKS username and password are acquired in the following way. First, if
the application has registered a java.net.Authenticator default instance, 
then this will be queried with the protocol set to the string "SOCKS5", 
and the prompt set to to the string "SOCKS authentication". If the 
authenticator does not return a username/password or if no authenticator 
is registered then the system checks for the user preferences 
"java.net.socks.username" and "java.net.socks.password".  If these 
preferences do not exist, then the system property "user.name" is checked
for a username. In this case, no password is supplied.
<dl>
<dt><b>socksProxyHost</b><br>
<b>socksProxyPort</b> (default: 1080)</dt>

<dd>Indicates the name of the SOCKS proxy server and the port number
that will be used by the SOCKS protocol layer.
If socksProxyHost is specified then all TCP sockets will use the
SOCKS proxy server to establish a connection or accept one.
The SOCKS proxy server can either be a SOCKS v4 or v5 server and it
has to allow for unauthenticated connections.
</dd>
<p>

<h3>Sun implementation-specific properties</h3>
<blockquote>
These properties may not be supported in future releases.

<dl>
<dt><b>sun.net.inetaddr.ttl</b></dt>

<dd>This is a sun private system property which corresponds to
<a href="#nct">networkaddress.cache.ttl</a>. It takes the same 
value and has the same meaning, but can be set as a command-line 
option. However, the preferred way is to use the security property 
<a href="#nct">mentioned above</a>.
</dd>
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<dt><b>sun.net.inetaddr.negative.ttl</b></dt>

<dd>This is a sun private system property which corresponds to 
<a href="#ncnt">networkaddress.cache.negative.ttl</a>. It takes the 
same value and has the same meaning, but can be set as a command-line 
option. However, the preferred way is to use the security property 
<a href="#ncnt">mentioned above</a>.
</dd>
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<dt><b>sun.net.client.defaultConnectTimeout</b> (default: -1)<br>
<b>sun.net.client.defaultReadTimeout</b> (default: -1)</dt>

<dd>These properties specify the default connect and read timeout 
(resp.) for the protocol handler used by java.net.URLConnection.
<p>
sun.net.client.defaultConnectTimeout specifies the timeout (in 
milliseconds) to establish the connection to the host. For example
for http connections it is the timeout when establishing the connection
to the http server. For ftp connection it is the timeout when
establishing the connection to ftp servers.
<p>
sun.net.client.defaultReadTimeout specifies the timeout (in
milliseconds) when reading from input stream when a connection is
established to a resource.</dd>
<p>
<hr>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<a name="jndi"><h3>JNDI DNS service provider settings</h3></a>
<blockquote>
These properties may not be supported in future releases.
<dl>
<dt><b>sun.net.spi.nameservice.provider.&lt;n&gt;=&lt;default|dns,sun|...&gt;</b>

<dd>Specifies the name service provider that you can use. By default, Java
will use the system configured name lookup mechanism, such as file,
nis, etc. You can specify your own by setting this option. <n> takes
the value of a positive number, it indicates the precedence order with
a small number takes higher precendence over a bigger number. In
J2SE<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> 1.4, we have provided one DNS 
name service provider through JNDI, which is called "dns,sun".</dd>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<dt><b>sun.net.spi.nameservice.nameservers=&lt;server1_ipaddr,server2_ipaddr ...&gt;</b></dt>

<dd>You can specify a comma separated list of IP addresses that point to
the DNS servers you want to use. If the 
sun.net.spi.nameservice.nameservers property is not
defined, then the provider will use any name servers already
configured in the platform DNS configuration.</dd>
<p>
<hr>
<p>

<dt><b>sun.net.spi.nameservice.domain=&lt;domainname&gt;</b></dt>

<dd>This property specifies the default DNS domain name, for instance,
eng.sun.com. If the sun.net.spi.nameservice.domain property is not
defined then the provider will use any domain or domain search
list configured in the platform DNS configuration.</dd>
<p>
</dl>
