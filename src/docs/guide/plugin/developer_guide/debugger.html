<p>Debugging Java applets in Java Plug-in has not been simple in the past, partly 
  because the applets use many services and facilities from the Java 2 Runtime 
  Environment, Java Plug-in, and the browser itself. If the applet does not work, 
  the developer needs to spend time diagnosing the problem. </p>
<p> The purpose of this document is to simplify the debugging process. It provides 
  techniques and suggestions for developing applets in Java Plug-in and describes 
  some common mistakes in applet development. 
<h2><a name="how"></a>How to Debug Applets in Java Plug-in</h2>
<p> In order to debug applets, you must have the appropriate version of the Java 
  2 SDK, Standard Edition, installed on your machine. Also make sure to compile 
  your <code>.java</code> files with <code>-g</code> option with <code>javac</code>. 
  To begin debugging your applet: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Start the Java Plug-in Control Panel. On the Advanced<i> </i>tab, specify 
    the following parameters in the Java Runtime Parameters: 
    <pre>
-Djava.compiler=NONE
-Xnoagent
-Xdebug 
-Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_shmem,address=
	&lt;connection-address&gt;,server=y,suspend=n
</pre>
    <p> The <i>&lt;connection-address></i> could be any string which is used by 
      the java debugger later to connect to the JVM. For example, 
    <pre>
-Djava.compiler=NONE
-Xnoagent
-Xdebug
-Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_shmem,address=2502,server=y,suspend=n</pre>
    <p> See <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/jpda/conninv.html">JPDA 
      Connection and Invocation</a> for the details on the possible runtime parameters 
      for debugging. 
  </li>
  <p> 
  <li>On the <i>Advanced</i> tab in the Java Plug-in Control Panel, select &quot;<code>JDK 
    &lt;<i>version</i>> in &lt;<i>jdk-path</i>&gt;</code>&quot; for the Java Runtime 
    Environment, where <code>&lt;<i>version</i>></code> is the Java Plug-in version 
    and <code>&lt;<i>jdk-path</i>&gt;</code> is the path to the Java 2 SDK installation. 
    For example, &quot;<code>JDK1.4 in C:\jdk1.4</code>&quot; . </li>
  <p> 
  <li>Start Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator and load the page which contains 
    the applet to be debugged. Make sure the applet code has been compiled with 
    <code>-g</code> option with <code>javac</code>. </li>
  <p> 
  <li>Run the command <code>jdb -attach &lt;<i>connection address</i>></code> 
    in a DOS command prompt. <code>&lt;<i>connection address</i>></code> is the 
    name mentioned in the step 1. For example, if <code>&lt;<i>connection address</i>></code> 
    is <code>2502</code>, you will run the command as 
    <pre>
		  jdb -attach 2502
</pre>
    To learn more about the Java Debugger (jdb), see <a href="../../../tooldocs/windows/jdb.html">The 
    Java Debugger</a>. </li>
  <p> 
  <li>Once the jdb has attached to the VM, you can set up breakpoints in the applet. 
  </li>
  <p>
  <li>When the applet in the browser reaches the breakpoint, it will stop executing, 
    and you will see the debugger waiting for your input to continue debugging. 
  </li>
</ol>
<p> When debugging applets in Java Plug-in, make sure that only one instance of 
  the browser is being used for debugging using the same connection address at 
  the same time. Otherwise, it will result in a conflict, since the Java Runtime 
  for each instance of the browser will try to gain exclusive access to the connection 
  address. To debug applets in both Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator, 
  run either Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator with Java Plug-in&#151;but 
  not both at the same time.</p>
<p> Debugging applets in Java Plug-in with Active Desktop is discouraged because 
  an instance of Internet Explorer will always be running in the desktop process 
  during the lifetime of the user session.</p>
<p> You can use other Java 2 debuggers, like Inprise's JBuilder or Symantac's 
  VisualCafe, instead of jdb. To use these debuggers, you will need to change 
  the project option in these IDEs to <i>attach</i> Java Plug-in in the browser 
  process on the same machine or remote machine. Different Java Runtime Parameters 
  may also be required in the Java Plug-in Control Panel. For more information, 
  consult your Java 2 debugger or IDE manuals.</p>
<h2><a name="jpic"></a>Java Plug-in Console</h2>
<p> One of the most powerful tools in Java Plug-in is the <a href="console.html">Java 
  Plug-in Console</a>. It is a simple console window for redirecting all the <code>System.out</code><i> 
  </i>and <code>System.err</code> messages. The console window is disabled by 
  default; it can be enabled from the Java Plug-in Control Panel or the task bar. 
  If the console is enabled, you will see the console window appear when Java 
  Plug-in is used in the browser. 
<h2><a name="jpitf"></a>Java Plug-in Trace File</h2>
<p> Similar to the Java Plug-in Console, this is a file that records all the <code>System.out</code> 
  and <code>System.err</code> messages. The trace file is disabled by default 
  but is automatically enabled when the Java Plug-in Console is enabled. The trace 
  file is normally located in <code>user.dir</code>, and the file is called <code>.plugin&lt;<i>version</i>&gt;.trace</code><i>.</i> 
  For example, in Windows NT this file is located in <tt>C:\WINNT\Profiles\&lt;<i>username</i>&gt;\.plugin&lt;<i>version</i>&gt;.trace.</tt> 
</p>
<h2><a name="jpitp"></a><code>javaplugin.trace</code> property</h2>
<p> This property controls whether Java Plug-in prints its trace messages during 
  execution. This is useful to applet developers to determine what is occuring 
  within Java Plug-in. The possible values are <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. 
  By default this property is <code>false</code>. To enable this property, set 
  <code>-Djavaplugin.trace=true</code> in the Java Runtime Parameters field in 
  the Advance Panel of the Java Plug-in Control Panel. </p>
<h2><a name="jsdp"></a><code>java.security.debug</code> property</h2>
<p>This property controls whether the security system of the Java 2 Runtime Environment 
  prints its trace messages during execution. This is usful when a security exception 
  is thrown in an applet or when a signed applet is not working. The following 
  options are supported: 
<ul>
  <li><code>access</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&#151; print all <code>checkPermission</code> 
    results</li>
  <li><code>jar</code><i> </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#151; 
    print jar verification information</li>
  <li><code>policy</code><i> </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#151; print policy information</li>
  <li><code>scl</code><i> </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#151; 
    print permissions <code>SecureClassLoader</code> assigns</li>
</ul>
<p> The following options can be used with <i><code>access</code></i>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>stack</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#151; include stack trace</li>
  <li><code>domain</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&#151; dumps all domains in context</li>
  <li><code>failure</code> &#151; before throwing exception, dump the stack and 
    domain that didn't have permission</li>
</ul>
<p> For example, to print all <code>checkPermission</code> results and dump all 
  domains in context, set <code>-Djava.security.debug=access:stack </code>in the 
  Java Runtime Parameters field in the Advanced Panel of the Java Plug-in Control 
  Panel. </p>
<h2><a name="online"></a>Documentation</h2>
<p> Java Plug-in provides a rich set of documentation to help developers use the 
  various features of Java Plug-in. The documentation includes a <a href="faq/index.html">FAQ</a>, 
  which includes some of the most frequently asked questions by developers. Make 
  sure you read and understand these documents before applet development, as it 
  may save you hundreds of hours in debugging. </p>
<h2><a name="isolating"></a>Isolating Bugs</h2>
<p> Although Java Plug-in provides the Java 2 Runtime Environment within Internet 
  Explorer and Netscape Navigator, most of the facilities are provided by the 
  Java 2 Runtime itself, rather than by Java Plug-in. Therefore, if a problem 
  occurs in Java Plug-in, it may be either a problem in Java Plug-in, the Java 
  2 Runtime itself or a user error. It is extremely important to determine where 
  bugs originate, as it will affect the speed of bug evaluation and fixing. Here 
  are some suggestions for isolating bugs: 
<ol>
  <li>Run the applets in both Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator through 
    Java Plug-in.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Run the applets in <code>appletviewer</code>. Java Plug-in is mainly derived 
    from <code>appletviewer</code> and has inherited problems from <code>appletviewer</code> 
    as well. This step should be performed only if the applet doesn't require 
    specific browser facilities that Java Plug-in provides, like HTTPS or RSA 
    signing.</li>
  <li>If the applet fails in <code>appletviewer</code>, it is likely the problem 
    is in the Java 2 Runtime Environment&#151;and not in Java Plug-in.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If the applet fails in only one of the browsers, IE or Netscape, it is likely 
    a Java Plug-in problem.</li>
  <li>If the applet fails in both browsers but not <code>appletviewer</code>, 
    it could be either a Java Plug-in problem or user error. Please examine the 
    applet code to see if it makes any assumptions about the execution environment. 
    For example, in <code>appletviewer</code> the current directory is set to 
    the current directory in the shell when <code>appletviewer</code> is launched, 
    whereas the current directory in Java Plug-in may be set to the browser's 
    directory. Therefore, loading resources from the current directory may work 
    in <code>appletviewer</code> but not in Java Plug-in.</li>
  <li>Try to reproduce the problem on other machines or platforms. In some cases, 
    the root of the problem may be in the machine configuration, e.g., an improper 
    DNS setup.</li>
  <li>If you have identified the problems in the Java 2 Runtime Environment or 
    Java Plug-in, please follow the instructions in the next section to submit 
    a bug report to the appropriate product categories.</li>
</ol>
