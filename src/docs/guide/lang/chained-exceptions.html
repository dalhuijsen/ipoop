It is common for Java code to catch one exception and throw another:
<blockquote><pre>
try {
    ...
} catch(YourException e) {
    throw new MyException();
}
</pre></blockquote>
Unfortunately, the information contained in the "causative exception"
(<tt>YourException</tt> in the example above) is generally lost, which greatly
complicates debugging. Recognizing this problem, developers sometimes build 
ad hoc mechanisms to allow certain "wrapped exceptions" to contain a second
exception.  An accessor is generally provided to extract the contained
exception.  Such mechanisms are sometimes known as "exception chaining
facilities", as they allow arbitrary chains of exceptions to be constructed
when contained exceptions are, themselves, wrapped exceptions.
<p>
There are many advantages to unifying all of these facilities.  Chief among
them are: (1) We guarantee that anyone who wants to record the fact that one
exception caused another can do so, regardless of what the exceptions are.
(2) By providing a common API to record the fact that one exception caused
another, we ease this task, making it more likely that programmers will take
the trouble to do it.  (3) By providing a common API to access causative
exceptions, we greatly increase the likelihood that this information will be
made available to those who need it.  In fact, the proposed mechanism prints
entire "causal chain" as part of the standard stack backtrace, ensuring that
preexisting programs will provide this information with no additional effort
on the part of their authors.
<p>
To address these issues, we have added two new methods to <tt>Throwable</tt>, 
<a href="../../api/java/lang/Throwable.html#getCause()"><tt>getCause()</tt></a> and
<a href="../../api/java/lang/Throwable.html#initCause(java.lang.Throwable)"><tt>initCause(Throwable)</tt></a>, and two new constructors, 
<a href="../../api/java/lang/Throwable.html#Throwable(java.lang.Throwable)"><tt>Throwable(Throwable)</tt></a> and
<a href="../../api/java/lang/Throwable.html#Throwable(java.lang.String, java.lang.Throwable)"><tt>Throwable(String, Throwable)</tt></a>.  Other "general purpose" exception classes
    (like <a href="../../api/java/lang/Exception.html"><tt>Exception</tt></a>, <a href="../../api/java/lang/RuntimeException.html"><tt>RunTimeException</tt></a> and 
<a href="../../api/java/lang/Error.html"><tt>Error</tt></a>) have been similarly outfitted
    with <tt>(Throwable)</tt> and <tt>(String,&nbsp;Throwable</tt>) constructors.  However, even
    exceptions without such constructors will be usable as "wrapped
    exceptions" via the <tt>initCause</tt> method. 
<p>The implementation of
    <a href="../../api/java/lang/Throwable.html#printStackTrace()"><tt>Throwable.printStackTrace</tt></a> has been modified to display backtraces for
    the entire causal chain of exceptions.  New method <tt><a href="../../api/java/lang/Throwable.html#getStackTrace()">getStackTrace</a></tt> provides programmatic access to the stack trace information 
provided by <tt>printStackTrace</tt>.
<p>
All of the platform's wrapped
    exceptions will be retrofitted to support the new facility
    (in addition to their legacy APIs).
