<blockquote>
The following Q&A addresses some of the design issues of the 
Shutdown Hooks API.
<p>
<b>Isn't this what <tt>runFinalizersOnExit</tt> is for?</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
You can use the <a
href="../../api/java/lang/Runtime.html#runFinalizersOnExit(boolean)">
<tt>Runtime.runFinalizersOnExit</tt></a> method, or the equivalent method in
the <a href="../../api/java/lang/System.html#runFinalizersOnExit(boolean)">
<tt>System</tt></a> class, to schedule actions to take place when the VM shuts
down due to exit.  This technique does not, however, work for
termination-triggered shutdowns.  It is also is inherently unsafe, and in fact
these methods were <a
href="../misc/threadPrimitiveDeprecation.html">
deprecated</a> in version 1.2 of the Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>&nbsp;2 Platform.
</blockquote>
<p>

<b>Why don't you provide information as to why the VM is shutting
down?</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
On some platforms a native process can't distinguish a shutdown due to exit
from a shutdown due to termination.  Other platforms provide much richer
capabilities, in some cases including notification of system suspension and
restart or of imminent power failure.  In short, it's impossible to generalize
such information in a portable way.
</blockquote>
<p>

<b>Will shutdown hooks be run if the VM crashes?</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
If the VM crashes due to an error in native code then no guarantee can be made
about whether or not the hooks will be run.
</blockquote>

<p><b>Why are shutdown hooks run concurrently?
 Wouldn't it make more sense to run them in reverse order of registration?
</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
Invoking shutdown hooks in their reverse order of registration is certainly
intuitive, and is in fact how the C runtime library's <tt>atexit</tt> procedure
works.  This technique really only makes sense, however, in a single-threaded
system.  In a multi-threaded system such as Java platform the order in which hooks are
registered is in general undetermined and therefore implies nothing about which
hooks ought to be run before which other hooks.  Invoking hooks in any
particular sequential order also increases the possibility of deadlocks.  Note
that if a particular subsystem needs to invoke shutdown actions in a particular
order then it is free to synchronize them internally.
</blockquote>

<p><b>Why are hooks just threads, and unstarted ones at that? 
Wouldn't it be simpler to use <tt>Runnable</tt> objects, or Beans-style
event and listener patterns?
</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
The approach taken here has two advantages over the more obvious, and more
frequently suggested, callback-oriented designs based upon <tt>Runnable</tt>
objects or Beans-style event listeners.

<p> First, it gives the user complete control over the thread upon which a
shutdown action is executed.  The thread can be created in the proper thread
group, given the correct priority, context, and privileges, and so forth.

<p> Second, it simplifies both the specification and the implementation by
isolating the VM from the hooks themselves.  If shutdown actions were executed
as callbacks then a robust implementation would wind up having to create a
separate thread for each hook anyway in order for them to run concurrently.
The specification would also have to include explicit language about how the
threads that execute the callbacks are created.
</blockquote>

<p><b>Aren't threads pretty expensive things to keep around, 
especially if they won't be started until the VM shuts down?</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
Most implementations of the Java platform don't actually allocate resources to a thread until
it's started, so maintaining a set of unstarted threads is actually very cheap.
If you look at the internals of <tt>java.lang.Thread</tt> you can
see that its various constructors just do security checks and initialize
private fields.  The native <tt>start()</tt> method does the real work of
allocating a thread stack, etc., to get things going.
</blockquote>

<p><b>What about Personal and Embedded Java? 
Won't starting threads during shutdown be too expensive on those
platforms?</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
This API may not be suitable for the smaller Java platforms.  Threads in 
the Java 2 Platform 
carry more information than threads in JDK 1.1 and p/eJava.  A thread has a
class loader, it may have some inherited thread-local variables, and, in the
case of GUI apps, it may be associated with a specific application context.
Threads will come to carry even more information as the platform evolves; for
example, the security team is planning to introduce a notion of per-thread user
identity in their upcoming authentication framework.

<p> Because of all this contextual information, shutdown hooks would be harder
to write and maintain if they were just <tt>Runnable</tt> objects or
Beans-style event listeners.  Suppose that a <tt>Runnable</tt> shutdown hook,
or an equivalent event listener, needed a specific bit of thread-contextual
information in order to carry out its operations.  Such information could be
saved in some shared location before the hook is registered.  While this is
merely awkward, suppose further that threads acquire some new type of
contextual information in a future release.  If an operation invoked by the
hook also evolves to need that information then the code that registers the
hook would have to be amended to save that information as well.  Making hooks
be threads instead of <tt>Runnable</tt>s or event listeners insulates them from
this sort of future change.
</blockquote>

<p><b>Okay, but won't I have to write a lot of code 
just to register a simple shutdown hook?</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
No.  Simple shutdown hooks can often be written as anonymous inner classes, as
in this example:

<blockquote><pre>
Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread() {
    public void run() { database.close(); }
});
</pre></blockquote>

This idiom is fine as long as you'll never need to cancel the hook, in which
case you'd need to save a reference to the hook when you create it.
</blockquote>

<p><b>What about security? 
Can an untrusted applet register a shutdown hook?</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
If there is a security manager installed then the <tt>addShutdownHook</tt> and
<tt>removeShutdownHook</tt> methods check that the caller's security context
permits <tt>RuntimePermission("shutdownHooks")</tt>.  An untrusted applet will
not have this permission, and will therefore not be able to register or
de-register a shutdown hook.
</blockquote>

<p><b>What happens if a shutdown hook throws an exception 
and the exception is not caught?
</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
Uncaught exceptions are handled in shutdown hooks just as in any other thread,
by invoking the <tt>uncaughtException</tt> method of the thread's
<tt>ThreadGroup</tt> object.  The default implementation of this method prints
the exception's stack trace to <tt>System.err</tt> and terminates the thread.
Note that uncaught exceptions do not cause the VM to exit; this happens only
when all non-daemon threads have finished or when the <tt>Runtime.exit</tt>
method is invoked.
</blockquote>

<p><b>Why did you add the <tt>Runtime.halt</tt> method? 
Isn't it pretty dangerous?</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
The new <tt>halt</tt> method is certainly powerful, and it should be used with
the utmost caution.  It's provided so that applications can insulate themselves
from shutdown hooks that deadlock or run for inordinate amounts of time.  It
also allows applications to force a quick exit in situations where that is
necessary.
</blockquote>

<p><b>What happens if finalization-on-exit is enabled? 
Will finalizers be run before, during, or after shutdown hooks?</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
Finalization-on-exit processing is done after all shutdown hooks have finished.
Otherwise a hook may fail if some live objects are finalized prematurely.
