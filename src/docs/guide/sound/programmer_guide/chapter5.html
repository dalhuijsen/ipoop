<p><a name="114180"> </a> <em>Capturing</em> refers to the process of obtaining 
  a signal from outside the computer. A common application of audio capture is 
  recording, such as recording the microphone input to a sound file. However, 
  capturing isn't synonymous with recording, because recording implies that the 
  application always saves the sound data that's coming in. An application that 
  captures audio doesn't necessarily store the audio. Instead it might do something 
  with the data as it's coming in&#151;such as transcribe speech into text&#151;but 
  then discard each buffer of audio as soon as it's finished with that buffer. 
</p>
<p><a name="114181"> </a> As discussed in Chapter 2, "<a href="chapter2.html">Overview 
  of the Sampled Package</a>," a typical audio-input 
  system in an implementation of the Java<font size="-1"><sup>TM</sup></font> 
  Sound API consists of: </p>
<ol>
<a name="113952"> </a>
<li>An input port, such as a microphone port or a line-in port, which feeds its incoming audio data into:
<a name="115691"> </a>
<li>A mixer, which places the input data in:
<a name="115692"> </a>
<li>One or more target data lines, from which an application can retrieve the data.
<p><a name="113956"> </a>

Commonly, only one input port can be open at a time, but an audio-input mixer that mixes audio from multiple ports is also possible. Another scenario consists of a mixer that has no ports but instead gets its audio input over a network. 
</p>
    <p><a name="113958"> </a> The <code>TargetDataLine</code> interface was introduced 
      briefly under "<a href="chapter2.html#112445">The Line Interface Hierarchy</a>" 
      in Chapter 2, "<a href="chapter2.html">Overview of the Sampled Package</a>." 
      <code>TargetDataLine</code> is directly analogous to the <code>SourceDataLine</code> 
      interface, which was discussed extensively in Chapter 4, "<a href="chapter4.html">Playing 
      Back Audio</a>." Recall that the <code>SourceDataLine</code> 
      interface consists of: </p>
  </ol>
<ul><a name="113960"> </a>
<li>A <code>write</code> method to send audio to the mixer
<a name="113961"> </a>
<li>An <code>available</code> method to determine how much data can be written to the buffer without blocking
<p><a name="113963"> </a>
</ul>
Similarly, <code>TargetDataLine</code> consists of: 
<ul>
<p></p><a name="113965"> </a>
<li>A <code>read </code>method to get audio from the mixer
<a name="113966"> </a>
<li>An <code>available</code> method to determine how much data can be read from the buffer without blocking 
</ul><a name="113969"> </a>
<h3> Setting Up a TargetDataLine</h3>
<p><a name="113971"> </a> The process of obtaining a target data line was described 
  in Chapter 3, "<a href="chapter3.html">Accessing Audio System Resources</a>," 
  but we repeat it here for convenience: </p>
<blockquote><pre><code>TargetDataLine line;
</code><code>DataLine.Info info = new DataLine.Info(TargetDataLine.class, <br>
    format); // format is an AudioFormat object
</code><code>if (!AudioSystem.isLineSupported(info)) {
</code><code>    // Handle the error ... 
</code><code>}
</code><code>// Obtain and open the line.
</code><code>try {<br>
    line = (TargetDataLine) AudioSystem.getLine(info);
</code><code>    line.open(format);
</code><code>} catch (LineUnavailableException ex) {
</code><code>    // Handle the error ... 
</code><code>}
</code><p><a name="113992"> </a>
</pre></blockquote>
You could instead invoke <code>Mixer's</code> <code>getLine</code> method, rather than <code>AudioSystem's</code>.
<p></p>
<p><a name="113994"> </a> As shown in this example, once you've obtained a target 
  data line, you reserve it for your application's use by invoking the <code>DataLine</code> 
  method <code>open</code>, exactly as was described in the case of a source data 
  line in Chapter 4, "<a href="chapter4.html">Playing Back Audio</a>." 
  The single-parameter version of the <code>open</code> method causes the line's 
  buffer to have the default size. You can instead set the buffer size according 
  to your application's needs by invoking the two-parameter version: 
<pre>    void open(AudioFormat format, int bufferSize) 
</pre>
When choosing a buffer size, keep in mind the tradeoff between the delays incurred 
by long buffers, on the one hand, and the risk of discontinuities in the audio 
if the buffers are so short that you can't retrieve the data fast enough, on the 
other hand. When capturing audio, you risk data overflow if you don't pull data 
from the filled buffers fast enough. If overflow occurs, some of the captured 
data will be discarded, which will probably cause audible clicks and skips in 
the sound. This is the opposite situation from playback, where you risk data underflow, 
which can result in gaps in the sound. (See Chapter 4, "<a href="chapter4.html">Playing 
Back Audio</a>," for more on choosing buffer 
sizes.)

<h3> Reading the Data from the TargetDataLine</h3>
<p><a name="114004"> </a>
Once the line is open, it is ready to start capturing data, but it isn't active yet. To actually commence the audio capture, use the <code>DataLine</code> method <code>start</code>. This begins delivering input audio data to the line's buffer for your application to read. Your application should invoke start only when it's ready to begin reading from the line; otherwise a lot of processing is wasted on filling the capture buffer, only to have it overflow (that is, discard data).
</p><p><a name="114006"> </a>
To start retrieving data from the buffer, invoke <code>TargetDataLine's</code> read method:
</p><blockquote><pre>int read(byte[] b, int offset, int length) 
</pre></blockquote>
This method attempts to read <code>length</code> bytes of data into the array <code>b</code>, starting at the byte position <code>offset</code> in the array. The method returns the number of bytes actually read. 
<p></p><p><a name="114011"> </a>
As with <code>SourceDataLine's write</code> method, you can request more data than actually fits in the buffer, because the method blocks until the requested amount of data has been delivered, even if you request many buffers' worth of data. 
</p><p><a name="115205"> </a>
To avoid having your application hang during recording, you can invoke the read method within a loop, until you've retrieved all the audio input, as in this example:
</p><blockquote><pre>
// Assume that the TargetDataLine, line, has already
// been obtained and opened.
ByteArrayOutputStream out  = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
int numBytesRead;
byte[] data = new byte[line.getBufferSize() / 5];

// Begin audio capture.
line.start();

// Here, stopped is a global boolean set by another thread.
while (!stopped) {
   // Read the next chunk of data from the TargetDataLine.
   numBytesRead =  line.read(data, 0, data.length);
   // Save this chunk of data.
   out.write(data, 0, numBytesRead);
}     
</pre></blockquote>
Notice that in this example, the size of the byte array into which the data is read is set to be one-fifth the size of the line's buffer. If you instead make it as big as the line's buffer and try to read the entire buffer, you need to be very exact in your timing, because data will be dumped if the mixer needs to deliver data to the line while you are reading from it. By using some fraction of the line's buffer size, as shown here, your application will be more successful in sharing access to the line's buffer with the mixer. 
<p></p><p><a name="114034"> </a>
The <code>read</code> method of <code>TargetDataLine</code> takes three arguments: a byte array, an offset into the array, and the number of bytes of input data that you would like to read. In this example, the third argument is simply the length of your byte array. The <code>read</code> method returns the number of bytes that were actually read into your array. 
</p>
<p><a name="114036"> </a> Typically, you read data from the line in a loop, as 
  in this example. Within the <code>while</code> loop, each chunk of retrieved 
  data is processed in whatever way is appropriate for the application&#151;here, 
  it's written to a <code>ByteArrayOutputStream</code>. Not shown here is the 
  use of a separate thread to set the boolean <code>stopped</code>, which terminates 
  the loop. This boolean's value might be set to <code>true</code> when the user 
  clicks a Stop button, and also when a listener receives a <code>CLOSE</code> 
  or <code>STOP</code> event from the line. The listener is necessary for <code>CLOSE</code> 
  events and recommended for <code>STOP</code> events. Otherwise, if the line 
  gets stopped somehow without stopped being set to <code>true</code>, the <code>while</code> 
  loop will capture zero bytes on each iteration, running fast and wasting CPU 
  cycles. A more thorough code example would show the loop being re-entered if 
  capture becomes active again. </p>
<p><a name="114039"> </a>
As with a source data line, it's possible to drain or flush a target data line. For example, if you're recording the input to a file, you'll probably want to invoke the <code>drain</code> method when the user clicks a Stop button. The <code>drain</code> method will cause the mixer's remaining data to get delivered to the target data line's buffer. If you don't drain the data, the captured sound might seem to be truncated prematurely at the end.
</p><p><a name="114041"> </a>
There might be some cases where you instead want to flush the data. In any case, if you neither flush nor drain the data, it will be left in the mixer. This means that when capture recommences, there will be some leftover sound at the beginning of the new recording, which might be undesirable. It can be useful, then, to flush the target data line before restarting the capture.

<h3> Monitoring the Line's Status</h3>
<p><a name="114046"> </a> Because the <code>TargetDataLine</code> interface extends 
  <code>DataLine</code>, target data lines generate events in the same way source 
  data lines do. You can register an object to receive events whenever the target 
  data line opens, closes, starts, or stops. For more information, see "<a href="chapter4.html#113711">Monitoring 
  the Line's Status</a>" in Chapter 4, "<a href="chapter4.html">Playing Back Audio</a>." 
</p>
<a name="114049"> </a>
<h3> Processing the Incoming Audio</h3>
<p><a name="114051"> </a> Like some source data lines, some mixers' target data 
  lines have signal-processing controls, such as gain, pan, reverb, or sample-rate 
  controls. The input ports might have similar controls, especially gain controls. 
  For more information on how to determine whether a line has such controls, and 
  how to use them if it does, see Chapter 6, "<a href="chapter6.html">Processing 
  Audio with Controls</a>." </p>
