    <h2>New JTree toggleClickCount Property</h2>
        
    <p>
      JTree now provides a property for configuring how many mouse clicks 
      are needed to expand/collapse a node.
      See:
<P>
    
<ul>
<tt>
<li><a href="../../../api/javax/swing/JTree.html#TOGGLE_CLICK_COUNT_PROPERTY">public final static String TOGGLE_CLICK_COUNT_PROPERTY</a>
<li><a href="../../../api/javax/swing/JTree.html#toggleClickCount">protected int toggleClickCount</a>
<li><a href="../../../api/javax/swing/JTree.html#setToggleClickCount(int)">public void setToggleClickCount(int clickCount)</a>

    <h2>New JTree Properties: Anchor, LeadSelectionPath</h2>

    <p>
      The TreeSelectionModel maintains a set of selected paths. Most UIs also 
      provide the notion of the lead path and the anchor path. The anchor 
      path is used for gestures that extend the selection, and the lead is 
      usually the path that was last added to the selection. The lead may also 
      be manipulated independently such that it isn't always selected.  Motif 
      does this, as do the control modifiers with the Java Look and 
      Feel (aka Metal). Support for this 
      was previously added in a private manner such that developers were not able to 
      determine what the anchor/lead were. The new API will expose this to 
      developers so that they can get the lead/anchor as well as programmatically 
      modify it. Exposing methods will also make it so that developers are 
      free to override the behavior in any way they see fit.
<P>

    <h2>Exposed DefaultTreeCellRenderer.hasFocus as a Protected Field</h2>

      <tt>DefaultTreeCellRenderer</tt> exposes almost all of the arguments passed in 
      via the <tt>getTreeCellRendererComponent</tt> method as protected instance 
      variables. This makes it easy for a subclass that wishes to only change 
      painting, as the subclass only has to override paint, and not 
      <tt>getTreeCellRendererComponent</tt> to track all the arguments themselves. The 
      <tt>hasFocus</tt> argument (last argument) was private. The <tt>hasFocus</tt> instance 
      variable is now protected vs private.

    
      <P>
      In <code>javax.swing.tree.DefaultTreeCellRenderer</code> see: 


    
 <ul>
<tt>
<li>
    <a href="../../../api/javax/swing/tree/DefaultTreeCellRenderer.html#hasFocus">protected boolean hasFocus</a>
    </tt>
</ul>


    <h2>Added TreeSelectionEvent.isAddedPath()</h2>


      TreeSelectionEvent encapsulates the delta of how the
      TreeSelectionModel changed. That is, it will contain any paths
      that have been added to the selection, as well as paths that have
      been removed.  To determine if a particular path is new to the
      selection model the <code>isAddedPath(TreePath)</code> method is
      provided. The <code>valueChanged(TreeSelectionEvent)</code>
      listener method usually takes the form of:

    <pre>  
TreePath[] paths = event.getPaths();
for (int counter = paths.length - 1; counter &gt;= 0; counter--) {
    if (event.isAddedPath(paths[counter])) ...
}
    </pre>

    <p>
      <tt>TreeSelectionEvent.isAddedPath(TreePath)</tt> has to iterate through the 
      TreePaths to determine the index of the TreePath in its internal 
      TreePath array, and then map that to a boolean to determine if it is a 
      new path. To avoid the step of <tt>isAddedPath(TreePath)</tt> iterating through 
      its TreePath array, <tt>isAddedPath(int)</tt> has been added.

    <p>

      In <code>javax.swing.event.TreeSelectionEvent</code> see:
    <ul>
<tt>
<li>
   <a href="../../../api/javax/swing/event/TreeSelectionEvent.html#isAddedPath(int)"> public boolean isAddedPath(int index)</a>
  </li>
</tt>
</ul>

    <h2>
      New JTree expandsSelectedPaths Property and
      removeDescendantSelectedPaths Method
    </h2>

      When the selection is programatically changed in a JTree, the selected 
      items are made visible (visible meaning all the parent items are 
      expanded). For certain applications this behavior is not desirable, eg 
      say all nodes of a certain type should be selected regardless of their 
      visibility. This behavior is implemented across JTree and BasicTreeUI, 
      making it tricky to override this behavior. The public methods 
      get/setExpandsSelectedPaths have been added to JTree. If set to false, 
      when the selection changes the nodes are not made visible, the default 
      is true.

    <p>
      The protected method removeDescendantSelectedPaths has also been added. 
      This method is called whenever a node is removed/collapsed to remove any 
      descendant selected paths. This provides a simple place for subclassers 
      to override should they not want the selection to change when a node is 
      removed/collapsed.
      
    <p>
See:
<tt>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../api/javax/swing/JTree.html#EXPANDS_SELECTED_PATHS_PROPERTY">public final static String EXPANDS_SELECTED_PATHS_PROPERTY</a>
<li><a href="../../../api/javax/swing/JTree.html#setExpandsSelectedPaths(boolean)">public void setExpandsSelectedPaths(boolean newValue)</a>
<li><a href="../../../api/javax/swing/JTree.html#getExpandsSelectedPaths()">public boolean getExpandsSelectedPaths()</a>

<li><a href="../../../api/javax/swing/JTree.html#removeDescendantSelectedPaths(javax.swing.tree.TreePath, boolean)">protected void removeDescendantSelectedPaths(TreePath path, boolean includePath)</a>
</ul>

</tt>


    <h2>DefaultTreeSelectionModel.insureUniqueness now Obsolete</h2>

    <p>
      DefaultTreeSelectionModel has the protected method insureUniqueness. It 
      would go through an array of TreePaths making sure there were no 
      duplicates. The implementation has changed such that a Hashtable is used 
      and this method is no longer needed, it has marked obsolete. The 
      implementation is now empty, but still invoked as before.


    <p>
      Here's the API and spec for the changes to
      <code>javax.swing.tree.DefaultTreeSelectionModel</code> 

    <pre>
    /**
     * This method is obsolete and its implementation is now a noop. It's
     * still called by setSelectionPaths and addSelectionPaths, but only
     * for backwards compatibility.
     */
    <a href="../../../api/javax/swing/tree/DefaultTreeSelectionModel.html#insureUniqueness()">protected void insureUniqueness()</a>
    </pre>
