<H2>Background: What It Means to Have "Privileged" Code</H2>

<blockquote>

<p>The policy for an SDK installation specifies what permissions -- which types 
of system resource accesses -- are allowed for code from specified code sources.
A "code source" (of type CodeSource) essentially consists of the code location 
(URL) and a reference to the certificate(s) containing the public key(s) 
corresponding to the private key(s) used to sign the code (if it was signed).

<p>The policy is represented 
by a Policy object. More specifically, it is represented by a
<code>Policy</code> subclass providing an implementation
of the abstract methods in the <code>Policy</code> class (which is 
in the <code>java.security</code> package).

<p>The source location for the policy information utilized by the
Policy object is up to the Policy implementation.
The Policy reference implementation obtains its
information from policy configuration files.
See <a href = "PolicyFiles.html">Default Policy Implementation
and Policy File Syntax</a>
for information about the Policy reference
implementation and the syntax that must be used
in policy files it reads.
For information about using the <b>Policy Tool</b> to create
a policy file (without needing to know the required syntax),
see the Policy Tool documentation
(<a href="../../tooldocs/solaris/policytool.html">for Solaris</a>) (<a href="../../tooldocs/windows/policytool.html">for Windows</a>).

<p>A "protection domain" encompasses a CodeSource and the permissions granted to code 
from that CodeSource, as determined by the security policy currently in effect.
Thus, classes signed by the same keys and from the same URL are placed in the same 
domain, and a class belongs to one and only one protection domain. 
Classes that have the same permissions but are from different code sources belong 
to different domains.

<p>Today all code shipped as part of the SDK is considered system code and run 
inside the unique system domain. System code automatically has all permissions.

<p>Each applet or application runs in its 
appropriate domain, determined by its code source.
In order for an applet (or an application running under a security
manager) to be allowed to perform a secured action (such as reading or 
writing a file), the applet or application must be
granted permission for that particular action.

<p>More specifically, whenever a resource access is attempted, <i>all</i> code 
traversed by the execution thread up to that point must have permission 
for that resource access, <i>unless some code on the thread has been marked 
as "privileged"</i>. That is, suppose access control checking occurs in a thread 
of execution that has a chain of multiple callers. (Think of this as 
multiple method calls that potentially cross the protection domain boundaries.) 
When the <code>AccessController</code> <code>checkPermission</code> method is 
invoked by the most recent caller, the basic algorithm for deciding whether to 
allow or deny the requested access is as follows:

<blockquote>

<p>If the code for any caller in the call chain does not have the requested 
permission, AccessControlException is thrown, <i>unless</i> 
the following is true - 
a caller whose code is granted the said permission has been marked as 
"privileged" (see below) and all parties subsequently called by this caller 
(directly or indirectly) all have the said permission.

</blockquote>

<p>Marking code as "privileged" enables a piece of trusted code to
temporarily enable access to more resources than are available directly to
the code that called it. This is necessary in some situations. For
example, an application may not be allowed direct access to files that
contain fonts, but the system utility to display a document must obtain
those fonts, on behalf of the user. In order to do this, the system utility 
becomes privileged while obtaining the fonts.

</blockquote>


<h2>Using the doPrivileged API</h2>

<blockquote>

The use of the "privileged" feature is described in the following sections.

<h3>No return value, no exception thrown</h3> 

<blockquote>
<p>If you don't need to return a value from within the "privileged" block, 
your call to <code>doPrivileged</code> can look like the following:

 <pre>
   somemethod() {
        ...normal code here...
        AccessController.doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction() {
            public Object run() {
                // privileged code goes here, for example:
                System.loadLibrary("awt");
                return null; // nothing to return
            }
        });
       ...normal code here...
  }
 </pre>

<p>The <CODE>AccessController.doPrivileged</CODE> method takes an object
of type <CODE>java.security.PrivilegedAction</CODE> and invokes its
<CODE>run</CODE> method in
privileged mode. The implementation guarantees that privileges will be 
revoked after the <CODE>run</CODE> method is executed, even if execution 
of <CODE>doPrivileged</CODE> is interrupted by an asynchronous exception.

<p>
<code>PrivilegedAction</code> is an interface with a single method, named
<code>run</code>, that returns an Object.
The above example shows creation of an implementation
of that interface using an anonymous inner class; 
a concrete implementation of the
<code>run</code> method is supplied.
When the call to <code>doPrivileged</code> is made, an 
instance of the PrivilegedAction implementation is passed
to it. The <code>doPrivileged</code> method calls the
<code>run</code> method from the PrivilegedAction 
implementation after enabling privileges, and returns the 
<code>run</code> method's return value as the 
<code>doPrivileged</code> return value (which is
ignored in this example).

<p>Note that depending on what "privileged code" actually consisted of,
you might have to make some changes due to the way inner classes
work. For example, if "privileged code" throws an exception or attempts
to access local variables then you will have to make some changes, as
shown in subsequent sections of this document.

<p>You can also call <code>doPrivileged</code> without using
an anonymous inner class, as in:

<pre>
    somemethod() {
        ...normal code here...
        MyAction mya = new MyAction();
        // become privileged:
        AccessController.doPrivileged(mya);
       ...normal code here...
    }

    class MyAction implements PrivilegedAction {
        public MyAction() {};
        public Object run() {
            // privileged code goes here, for example:
            System.loadLibrary("awt");
            return null; // nothing to return
        }
    }
</pre>

<p> Be <i>very</i> careful in your use of the "privileged" construct, and 
always remember to make the privileged code section as small as possible,
that is, try and limit the code within the <code>run</code> method to only the 
code that needs to be run with privileges, and do more general things outside
the <code>run</code> method. Also note that the call to <code>doPrivileged</code> 
should be made in the code that wants to enable its privileges. Do not 
be tempted to write a utility class that itself calls
<code>doPrivileged</code> as that could lead to security holes.
You can write utility classes for <code>PrivilegedAction</code> classes though,
as shown in the example above.

</blockquote>


<h3>Returning values</h3> 

<blockquote>

<p> If you need to return a value, you can do something like the following:

 <pre>
   somemethod() {
        ...normal code here...
        String user = (String) AccessController.doPrivileged(
          new PrivilegedAction() {
            public Object run() {
                return System.getProperty("user.name");
            }
          }
        );
        ...normal code here...
  }
 </pre>

<p> Note that this usage requires a dynamic cast on the value returned
by <code>doPrivileged</code>. An alternative is to use a 
<code>final</code> local variable:


 <pre>
   somemethod() {
        ...normal code here...
        final String user[] = {null};
        AccessController.doPrivileged(
          new PrivilegedAction() {
            public Object run() {
                user[0] = System.getProperty("user.name");
                return null; // still need this
            }
          }
        );
        ...normal code here...
  }
 </pre>

Yet another alternative would be to write a non-anonymous class
that safely handles types for you:

 <pre>
   somemethod() {
        ...normal code here...
        GetPropertyAction gpa = new GetPropertyAction("user.name");
        AccessController.doPrivileged(gpa);
        String user = gpa.getValue();
        ...normal code here...
   }

   class GetPropertyAction implements PrivilegedAction {
      private String property;
      private String value;
      public GetPropertyAction(String prop) { property = prop;}
      public Object run() { 
               value = System.getProperty(property);
               return value;
      } 
      public String getValue() {return value;}

   }
</pre>

<p> Note there are now no type-casts involved, although the <code>run</code>
method still returns a value, so you could still have a "one-liner" if you 
wanted to:

<pre>
   somemethod() {
        ...normal code here...
        String user = (String) AccessController.doPrivileged(
                                   new GetPropertyAction("user.name"));
        ...normal code here...
   }
</pre>

</blockquote>


<h3>Accessing local variables</h3>

<blockquote>

<p> If you are using an anonymous inner class, any local variables you 
access must be <code>final</code>. For example:

 <pre>
   somemethod() {
        ...normal code here...
        final String lib = "awt";
        AccessController.doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction() {
            public Object run() {
                // privileged code goes here, for example:
                System.loadLibrary(lib);
                return null; // nothing to return
            }
        });
       ...normal code here...
  }
 </pre>
<p>The variable <code>lib</code> must be declared <code>final</code> if you intend
to use it within the privileged block. See the 

<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/archive/jdk/1.1/index.html">"Inner Classes"</a> spec for more information on this topic.

<p>If there are cases where you can't make an existing variable <code>final</code>
(because it gets set multiple times), then you can create a new <code>final</code>
variable right before invoking <code>doPrivileged</code>, and set that
variable equal to the other variable. For example:

 <pre>
   somemethod() {
        ...normal code here...
        String lib;
        ...
        // lib gets set multiple times so we can't make it final
        ...
        // create a final String that we can use inside of the run method
        final String fLib = lib;
        AccessController.doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction() {
            public Object run() {
                // privileged code goes here, for example:
                System.loadLibrary(fLib);
                return null; // nothing to return
            }
        });
       ...normal code here...
  }
 </pre>

</blockquote>


<h3>Handling Exceptions</h3>

<blockquote>

 <p>If the action performed in your <code>run</code> method could
 throw a "checked" exception (one that must be listed in the 
<code>throws</code> clause  of a method), then you need to use the 
 <code>PrivilegedExceptionAction</code> interface instead of the
 <code>PrivilegedAction</code> interface:
 
 <pre>
   somemethod() throws FileNotFoundException {
        ...normal code here...
      try {
        FileInputStream fis = (FileInputStream) AccessController.doPrivileged(
          new PrivilegedExceptionAction() {
            public Object run() throws FileNotFoundException {
                return new FileInputStream("someFile");
            }
          }
        );
      } catch (PrivilegedActionException e) {
        // e.getException() should be an instance of FileNotFoundException,
        // as only "checked" exceptions will be "wrapped" in a
        // <code>PrivilegedActionException</code>.
        throw (FileNotFoundException) e.getException();
      }
        ...normal code here...
  }
 </pre>

<p>If a checked exception is thrown during execution of the <code>run</code>
method, it is placed in a PrivilegedActionException 
"wrapper" exception that is then thrown and should be caught by your code,
as illustrated in the above example..

</blockquote>


<H2>Reflection</H2>

<blockquote>

One subtlety that must be considered is the interaction of this API with
reflection. The <code>doPrivileged()</code> method can be invoked reflectively
using <code>java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke()</code>. In this case, the privileges
granted in privileged mode are not those of <code>Method.invoke()</code> but
of the non-reflective code that invoked it. Otherwise, system privileges
could erroneously (or maliciously) be conferred on user code. Note that
similar requirements exist when using the existing
API via reflection.
