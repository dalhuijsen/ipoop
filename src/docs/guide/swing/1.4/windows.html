<h1>Windows Look and Feel Update</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The ideal Swing application running under the Windows look and feel would be
indistinguishable from its native running counterparts, however due to both
changes in the native Windows look and feel (Windows 98, Windows 2000, etc.)
and atrophy of our existing Windows look and feel implementation, this has not
been the reality. However, for this release we have provided an updated Windows
look and feel which integrates seamlessly into the Windows desktop.

<p>This project was composed of a set of independent smaller projects, which
involve either fixing a previous emulation deficiency or adding functionality to
track 2000/98 features. In some cases the project spans both Swing and AWT:

<ul>
 <li><a href="#bugs">Fix Emulation Bugs</a>
 <li><a href="#desktopprops">Desktop Property Support</a>
 <li><a href="#lists">Column-Wrapping Lists</a> 
 <li><a href="#hottrack">Hot-tracking Toolbar Buttons</a>
 <li><a href="#gradient">Gradient Titlebars</a>
 <li><a href="#keyboard">Keyboard Navigation Hiding</a>
 <li><a href="#wheel">Scroll Wheel Support</a>
 <li><a href="#transition">Menu/Tooltip Transition Effects</a>
 <li><a href="#filechooser">FileChooser Makeover</a>
</ul>

<p>We chose to modify and enhance the <code>com.sun.java.swing.plaf.windows</code>
look and feel package rather than introduce a new 'window2000' package.
Almost all of the new functionality is keyed off of Windows native
user preferences so that an updated windows look and feel package gracefully runs on
eitherWindows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT or Windows 2000 machines. In other
words, if a running Swing application detects that a particular user preference
(such as Menu fading) doesn't exist, then the windows look and feel will not
execute that feature.

<p>The focus of this project was quality, not quantity. Where we deemed it
difficult to implement a feature with a high quality result, we
deferred that feature to a future release when we can emulate it with better
fidelity.


<h3><a name=bugs>Fix Emulation Bugs</a></h3>

<p>There were many bugs filed against our Windows look and feel and
we fixed many of these with this release.
We are tracking these bugs witha &quot;w2k&quot; keyword. See
<a href="w2k_bugs.html">Windows Look And Feel Buglist</a> for a list
of these windows look and feel bugs.

<h3><a name=desktopprops>Desktop Property Support</a></h3>

<p>The current Windows look and feel in Swing only tracks the user's desktop
colorscheme (via AWT's SystemColor mechanism). However, on the Windowsdesktop,
the user can set many more GUI preferences, such as fonts, sounds, metrics,
and can change them at any time and have Windows programs dynamically reflect
those changes. We have revised Swing to honor a wider range of user preferences
and to also support responding to dynamic changes made by the user. See
<a href="w2k_props.html">Windows Desktop Properties Support
Specification</a> for details.

<h3><a name=lists>Column-Wrapping Lists</a></h3>

<p>List was only capable of displaying a single column
and has been updated to support wrapping into
multiple columns (like the Windows Explorer pane).
This feature is also used
to better support the Windows filechooser. See
<a href="../SwingChanges.html#4308384">JList Spec update</a> for details.

<h3><a name=hottrack>Hot-Tracking Toolbar Buttons</a></h3>

<p>Buttons contained inside toolbars have
become flat in appearance and only when they are 'rolled over' do the borders
appear. This feature is supported by the Metal look and feel, but will be added
as a general Swing toolbar feature.

<h3><a name=gradient>Gradient Titlebars</a></h3>

<p>The titlebars on toplevel windows in Windows 2000 by default
use a gradient pattern instead of a solid bar color. We
get this for free on toplevel windows such as <code>JFrame</code>,
however we will use Java2D to implement this rendering for
<code>JInternalFrame</code>.


<h3><a name=wheel>Scroll Wheel Support</a></h3>

<p>Almost all PCs these days come with a
scroll-wheel on the mouse and to support this AWT is adding support for scroll
wheel input and Swing's scrolling components (<code>JScrollPane</code>,
<code>JScrollbar</code>) are being modified to handle this new event type.
See <a href="../SwingChanges.html#mouseWheel">MouseWheel API for details of AWT support</a> and
see <a href="../SwingChanges.html#4356268">JScrollPane changes</a> for details of support
in Swing.

<h3><a name=keyboard>Keyboard Navigation Hiding</a></h3>

<p>In windows the user can set a desktop property which causes
applications to hide their keyboard navigation cues
*until* ALT is pressed, at which time they magically appear. If the user has
this option set on the desktop, Swing will implement this behavior in its menus.
See <a href="keyboard_nav_hiding.html">Keyboard Navigation
Spec</a> for more information.

<h3><a name=transition>Menu/Tooltip Transition Effects</a></h3>

<p>The most obvious feature addition to
the Windows look and feel is the new stylistic menu animation.
In Windows 98, menus can be set to appear by sliding out.
Windows 2000 then introduced a very
hip fade-in/fade-out for menus and tooltips.

<p>In order to ensure the most accurate
visual effect, this feature is implemented by forcing menus/tooltips to be true
toplevel &quot;heavyweight&quot; windows which can take advantage of 
Microsoft Windows native window animation functionality inside the AWT.

<h3><a name=filechooser>File Chooser Makeover</a></h3>

<p>Although Swing's <code>JFileChooser</code>
component closely resembles the Windows file chooser, there are some
deficiencies which limit its use on the Windows platform, such as the lack of
support for network browsing and the Windows virtual desktop(&quot;My
Computer&quot;, &quot;My Network&quot;, etc.). See
<a href="../SwingChanges.html#JFileChooser">JFileChooser Spec update</a> for more
information.</p>
