<H2>What is the Portable Object Adapter (POA)?</H2>

<P>An <em>object adapter</em> is the mechanism that connects a request using
an object reference with the proper code to service that request.  The
 Portable Object Adapter, or POA, is a particular type of object adapter that
 is defined by the CORBA specification.  The POA is designed to meet the following goals:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Allow programmers to construct object implementations that are portable between different 
ORB 
products.
<LI>Provide support for objects with persistent identities.
<LI>Provide support for transparent activation of objects.
<LI>Allow a single <a href="jidlGlossary.html#servant">servant</a> to support multiple object 
identities simultaneously.
</UL>

<P>This document presents an introduction to using the POA with the Java 2 Platform, 
Standard Edition.  For a more complete description of the POA, see Chapter 11 of the 
<em><a href="http://www.omg.org/docs/formal/99-10-07.pdf">CORBA 2.3.1 
Specification</a></em>.  


<!--  ********** Using the POA  ***************-->
<a name="using"></a>
<H2>Creating and Using the POA</H2>

<P>The steps for creating and using a POA will vary according to the specific application 
being 
developed.  The following steps generally occur during the POA life cycle:
<P>
<OL>
<LI><a href="#create">Get the root POA</a>
<LI><a href="#policy">Define the POA's policies</a>
<LI><a href="#createpoa">Create the POA</a>
<LI><a href="#poamanager">Activate the POAManager</a>
<LI><a href="#servant">Activate the servants</a>, which may include activating the Tie
<LI><a href="#objref">Create the object reference from the POA</a>
</OL>

<P>Each step is described in more detail in the sections that follow.


<!--  **********  Get THE ROOT POA ***************-->
<a name="create"></a>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Step 1: Get the root POA</STRONG></FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The first step is to get the first POA, which is called the <em>rootPOA</em>.  

The root POA is managed by the ORB and provided to the application using the ORB 
initialization interface under the initial object name "RootPOA". 

  <P>An example of code that will get the root POA object and cast it to a POA is:
<P>
<PRE>
      ORB orb = ORB.init( args, null );
      POA rootPOA = POAHelper.narrow(orb.resolve_initial_references("RootPOA"));
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<!--  ********** Define the POA's Policies ***************-->
<a name="policy"></a>
<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Step 2: Define the POA's Policies</STRONG></FONT>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Portable Object Adapter (POA) is designed to provide an object adapter that can be 
used with 
multiple ORB implementations with no rewriting needed to deal with different vendors' 
implementations.  

<P>The POA is also intended to allow persistent objects -- at least, from the client's 
perspective. 
That is, as far as the client is concerned, these objects are always alive, and maintain data 
values 
stored in them, even though physically, the server
 may have been restarted many times. 

<P>The POA allows the object implementer a lot more control over the object's identity, 
state, storage, 
and life cycle. You can create a POA without defining any policies and the default values 
will be used. 
 The root POA has the following policies by default:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Thread Policy: ORB_CTRL_MODEL 
<LI>Lifespan Policy: TRANSIENT
<LI>Object Id Uniqueness Policy: UNIQUE_ID
<LI>Id Assignment Policy: SYSTEM_ID
<LI>Servant Retention Policy: RETAIN
<LI>Request Processing Policy: USE_ACTIVE_OBJECT_MAP_ONLY
<LI>Implicit Activation Policy: IMPLICIT_ACTIVATION
</UL>

<P>The following code snippet shows how policies are set
in the <a href="../rmi-iiop/rmiiiopexample.html#server">RMI-IIOP (with POA)</a> example:
<P>
<pre>
      Policy[] tpolicy = new Policy[3];
      tpolicy[0] = rootPOA.create_lifespan_policy(
        LifespanPolicyValue.TRANSIENT );
      tpolicy[1] = rootPOA.create_request_processing_policy(
        RequestProcessingPolicyValue.USE_ACTIVE_OBJECT_MAP_ONLY );
      tpolicy[2] = rootPOA.create_servant_retention_policy(
        ServantRetentionPolicyValue.RETAIN);
</pre>



<P>Each policy is discussed briefly in the following topics.  For more information on POA 
policies,

<!--  ********** Thread Policy ***************-->
<a name="thread"></a>
<H4>Thread Policy</H4>

<P>This policy specifies the threading model used with the created POA. The default is
<code>ORB_CTRL_MODEL</code>. 

<P>The <code>ThreadPolicyValue</code> can have the following values:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><code>ORB_CTRL_MODEL</code> - The ORB is responsible for assigning requests for an 
ORB-controlled 
POA to threads. 
<LI><code>SINGLE_THREAD_MODEL</code> - Requests for a single-threaded POA are processed 
sequentially. 
(<STRONG>NOTE: </STRONG> This policy is not supported in the ORB
shipped with Sun's J2SE v.1.4.1).
</UL>

<!--  ********** Lifespan Policy ***************-->
<a name="lifespan"></a>
<H4>Lifespan Policy</H4>

<P>This policy specifies the lifespan of the objects implemented in the created POA. The 
default is 
<code>TRANSIENT</code>. 

<P>The <code>LifespanPolicyValue</code> can have the following values:
	<UL>
	 <LI><code>TRANSIENT</code> - The objects implemented in the POA 
	  cannot outlive the POA instance in which they are 
	  first created. 
	 <LI><code>PERSISTENT</code> - The objects implemented in the POA can 
	  outlive the process in which they are first created.
	 </UL>

<!--  ********** Object Id Uniqueness Policy ***************-->
<a name="oi"></a>
<H4>Object Id Uniqueness Policy</H4>

<P>This policy specifies whether the servants activated in the created POA must have unique 
object 
identities. The default is <code>UNIQUE_ID</code>. 

<P>The <code>IdUniquenessPolicyValue</code> can have the following values:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><code>UNIQUE_ID</code> - Servants activated with that POA support exactly one Object Id.
<LI><code>MULTIPLE_ID</code> - A servant activated with that POA may support one or more
Object Ids. 
</UL>


<!--  ********** Id Assignment Policy ***************-->
<a name="ia"></a>
<H4>Id Assignment Policy</H4>
<P>This policy specifies whether Object Ids in the created POA are generated by the 
application or by 
the ORB. The default is <code>SYSTEM_ID</code>. 

<P>The <code>IdAssignmentPolicyValue</code> can have the following values:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><code>USER_ID</code> - Objects created with that POA are
assigned Object Ids only by the application. 
<LI><code>SYSTEM_ID</code> - Objects created with that POA are assigned
a unique object id  by the POA. If the POA also has the <code>PERSISTENT</code> policy, 
assigned Object 
Ids must be unique across all instantiations of the same POA. 
</UL>




<!--  ********** Servant Retention Policy ***************-->
<a name="sr"></a>
<H4>Servant Retention Policy</H4>


<P>This policy specifies whether the created POA retains active servants in an Active Object 
Map.  The 
default is <code>RETAIN</code>.

<P>The <code>ServantRetentionPolicyValue</code> can have the following 
	  values. 
	  <UL>
	  <LI><code>RETAIN</code> - to indicate that the POA will retain 
	  active servants in its Active Object Map.

	  </UL>

<!--  ********** Request Processing Policy ***************-->
<a name="rp"></a>
<H4>Request Processing Policy</H4>

<P>This policy specifies how requests are processed by the created POA. The default is
<code>USE_ACTIVE_OBJECT_MAP_ONLY</code>. 

<P>The  <code>RequestProcessingPolicyValue</code> can have the following
	  values:  
	  <UL>
	  <LI><code>USE_ACTIVE_OBJECT_MAP_ONLY</code> - If the object ID 
	  is not found in the Active Object Map, 
	  an <code>OBJECT_NOT_EXIST</code> exception is returned to the 
	  client. The <code>RETAIN</code> policy is also required.
	  <LI><code>USE_DEFAULT_SERVANT</code> - If the object ID is not found in 
	  the Active Object Map or the <code>NON_RETAIN</code> policy is 
	  present, and a default servant has been registered 
	  with the POA using the <code>set_servant</code> operation, 
	  the request is dispatched to the default servant. 
	  <LI><code>USE_SERVANT_MANAGER</code> - If the object ID is not found 
	  in the Active Object Map or the <code>NON_RETAIN</code> policy 
	  is present, and a servant manager has been registered 
	  with the POA using the <code>set_servant_manager</code> operation, 
	  the servant manager is given the opportunity to 
	  locate or activate a servant or raise an exception. 
	  </UL>

<!--  **********Implicit ActivationPolicy ***************-->
<a name="ia"></a>
<H4>Implicit Activation Policy</H4>

<P>This policy specifies whether implicit activation of servants is supported in the created 
POA. The 
default value is <code>IMPLICIT_ACTIVATION</code>.

<P>The <code>ImplicitActivationPolicyValue</code> can have the following values:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><code>IMPLICIT_ACTIVATION</code> - Indicates implicit
activation of servants. This requires <code>SYSTEM_ID</code> and 
<code>RETAIN</code> policies to be set.

<!--  ********** CREATE THE POA  ***************-->
<a name="createpoa"></a>
<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Step 3: Create the POA</STRONG></FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Creating a new POA allows the application developer to declare specific policy choices for 
the new 
POA and to provide a different <a href="#adapteractivator">adapter activator</a> and <a 
href="#servantmanager">servant manager</a> (these are callback objects used by the POA to 
activate POAs 
on demand and activate servants). Creating new POAs also allows the application developer to 
partition 
the name space of objects, as Object Ids are interpreted relative to a POA. Finally, by 
creating new 
POAs, the developer can independently control request processing for multiple sets of 
objects.

<P>A POA is created as a child of an existing POA using the <tt>create_POA</tt>
operation on the parent POA.  To create a new POA, pass in the following information: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Name of the POA. The POA is given a name that must be unique with respect to all other 
POAs with 
the same parent.  In the following example, the POA is named <code>childPOA</code>.
<LI>POA Manager.  Specify the POA Manager to be associated with the new POA.  If, as is
shown in the following example, <tt>null</tt> is passed for this parameter, a new POA 
Manager will be created. The user can also choose to pass the POA Manager of another POA.
<LI>Policy List.  Specify the policy list to be associated with the POA to control its 
behavior.  In 
the following example, a persistent lifespan policy has already been defined for this POA.  
</UL>


<P>The following code snippet shows how the POA is created
in the <a href="jidlExample2.html#server">Hello World: Persistent Server</a> example.


<UL><PRE>
// Create a POA by passing the Persistent Policy
POA persistentPOA = rootPOA.create_POA("childPOA", null, 
   persistentPolicy );

</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>



<!--  ********** POA MANAGER ***************-->
<a name="poamanager"></a>
<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Step 4: Activate the POAManager</STRONG></FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Each POA object has an associated <code>POAManager</code> object that controls
the processing  state of the POAs with which it is associated, such as  whether requests to 
the POA are 
queued or discarded.  The  <code>POAManager</code> can also
deactivate the POA.  A POA Manager may be associated with one or more 
 POA objects.  
 
<P>The <code>POAManager</code> can have the following states: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Holding - In this state, associated POAs will queue incoming requests. 
<LI>Active - In this state, associated POAs will start processing requests.
<LI>Discarding - In this state, associated POAs will discard incoming requests. 
<LI>Inactive  -  In this state, associated POAs will reject the requests that have not begun 
executing 
as well as as any new requests. 
</UL>

<P>The <a href="../../api/org/omg/PortableServer/POAManagerOperations.html">
<code>POAManagerOperations</code></a> javadocs contain more information on
these states.


<P>POA Managers are not automatically activated when they are created. The following code 
snippet shows 
how the <tt>POAManager</tt> is activated
in the <a href="jidlExample2.html#server">Hello World: Persistent Server</a> example.
If the POA Manager is not activated in this way, all calls to the 
<code>Servant</code> will hang because, by default, the POA Manager is in the 
<code>HOLD</code> state.
 
<P><PRE>
            // Activate PersistentPOA's POAManager. Without this step,
            // all calls to Persistent Server will hang because POAManager
            // will be in the 'HOLD' state.

<!--  ********** SERVANTS ***************-->
<a name="servant"></a>
<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Step 5: Activate the servants</STRONG></FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The following information is quoted from section 11.2.5 of the <em>CORBA 
Specification</em>.

<blockquote>At any point in time, a CORBA object may or may not be associated with an active 
servant. 

<P>If the POA has the <code>RETAIN</code> policy, the servant and its associated Object Id 
are entered 
into the Active Object Map of the appropriate POA. This type of activation can be 
accomplished in one 
of the following ways.

<P>
<UL>
<LI>The server application itself explicitly activates individual objects (via the 
<code>activate_object</code> or <code>activate_object_with_id</code> operations).<P>
<LI>The server application instructs the POA to activate objects on demand by having the POA 
invoke a 
user-supplied servant manager. The server application registers this servant manager with 
<code>set_servant_manager</code>.<P>
<LI>Under some circumstances (when the <code>IMPLICIT_ACTIVATION</code> policy is also in 
effect and 
the language binding allows such an operation), the POA may implicitly activate an object 
when the 
server application attempts to obtain a reference for a servant that is not already active 
(that is, 
not associated with an Object Id).
</UL>

<P>If the <code>USE_DEFAULT_SERVANT</code> policy is also in effect, the server application 
instructs 
the POA to activate unknown objects by having the POA invoke a single servant no matter what 
the Object 
Id is. The server application registers this servant with <code>set_servant</code>. 

<P>If the POA has the <code>NON_RETAIN</code> policy, for every request, the POA may use 
either a 
default servant or a servant manager to locate an active servant. From the POA's point of 
view, the 
servant is active only for the duration of that one request. The POA does not enter the 
servant-object 
association into the Active Object Map.
</blockquote>


<P>When using RMI-IIOP technology, your implementations use delegation (known as the Tie 
model) to 
associate your implementation with the interface.  When you create an instance of your 
implementation,  
you also need to create a Tie object to associate it 
with a CORBA interface. The following code snippet shows  how to activate the Tie, if the POA 
policy is 
<code>USE_ACTIVE_OBJECT_MAP_ONLY</code>.  This sample code is from  the <a 
href="../rmi-iiop/rmiiiopexample.html#server">RMI-IIOP with POA</a> example.
<P>
<UL>
<PRE>
_HelloImpl_Tie tie = (_HelloImpl_Tie)Util.getTie( helloImpl );
String helloId = "hello";
byte[] id = helloId.getBytes();

</pre>
</UL>

<P>The CORBA Specification discusses creating object references (section 11.2.4),
activating objects (section 11.2.5), and processing requests (section 11.2.6) in 
more detail than is done in this document.  Please refer to the

<!--  **********  OBJECT REFERENCES ***************-->
<a name="objref"></a>
<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Step 6: Create the object reference</STRONG></FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Object references are created in servers. Once created, they may be 
exported to clients.  Object references encapsulate object identity
information and information required by the ORB to identify and locate
 the server and the POA with which the object is associated. References are created
 in the following ways:
 
 <P>
 <UL>
 <LI>Explicitly activate a servant and associate it with an object reference.
 
 <P>The following example is from <a href="jidlExample2.html#server">Hello World: Persistent

<!--  ********** ADAPTER ACTIVATORS ***************-->
<a name="adapteractivator"></a>
<H2>Adapter Activators</H2>

<P><STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>
For an example application that uses Adapter Activators, see <a 
href="adapteractivator.html"><em>Using Adapter Activators</em></a>.</STRONG>
</UL>
<P>An <strong>adapter activator</strong> is optional.  You would use an adapter activator if 
POAs need 
to be created during request processing.  If all needed POAs are created when the application 
is 
executed, an adapter activator is not required.


<P>An adapter activator supplies a POA with the ability to create child POAs on demand, as a 
side-effect of receiving a request that names the
child POA (or one of its children), or when the <code>find_POA</code> method is called with 
an activate 
parameter value of TRUE.  The ORB will invoke an operation on an adapter activator when a 
request is 
received for a child POA that does not currently exist. The adapter activator can then create 
the 
required POA on demand.

<P>A request must be capable of conveying the Object Id of the target object as well as the 
identification of the POA that created the target object reference. When a client issues a 
request, the 
ORB first locates an appropriate server (perhaps starting one if needed) and then it locates 
the 
appropriate POA within that server. 

<P>If the POA does not exist in the server process, the application has the opportunity to 
re-create 
the required POA by using an adapter activator. An adapter activator is a user-implemented 
object that 
can be associated with a POA. It is invoked by the ORB when a request is received for a 
non-existent 
child POA. The adapter activator has the opportunity to create the required POA. If it does 
not, the 
client receives the <code>ADAPTER_NONEXISTENT</code> exception. 

<P>Once the ORB has located the appropriate POA, it delivers the request to that POA. The 
further 
processing of that request depends both upon the policies associated with that POA as well as 
the 
object's current state of activation.




<P>For more information on Adapter Activators, 
please refer to section 11.3.3 of the

<!--  ********** SERVANT MANAGERS ***************-->
<a name="servantmanager"></a>
<H2>Servant Managers</H2>

<P>Servant Managers are optional.   You would use a servant manager to allow the POA to 
activate 
servants on demand when a request for an inactive object is received.  If your server loads 
all objects 
when it starts up, you do not need a servant manager.  

<P>A <strong>servant manager</strong> is a callback  object that the application developer 
can 
associate with a POA. The ORB will invoke operations on servant managers to activate servants 
on 
demand, and to deactivate servants. Servant managers are responsible for managing the 
association of an 
object reference (as characterized by its Object Id value) with a particular servant, and for 
determining whether an object reference exists or not. Each servant manager type contains two 
operations, the first called to find and return a servant and the second to deactivate a 
servant. The 
operations differ according to the amount of information usable for their situation.

<P>To use servant managers, the <code>USE_SERVANT_MANAGER</code> policy must be set.  Once 
set, the 
type of servant manager used in a particular situation depends on other policies in the POA.  
The two 
types of servant managers are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><code><a 
href="../../api/org/omg/PortableServer/ServantActivatorOperations.html">
ServantActivator</a></code>
<P>When the POA has the <code>RETAIN</code> policy, it uses servant managers that are 
<code>ServantActivators</code>. 
<P>This type is typically used to activate persistent objects. 
<P><UL>
<LI><STRONG>For an example that uses Servant Activators, see 
<a href="servantactivator.html">Using Servant Activators</a>. </STRONG>
</UL>

<P>
<LI><code><a 
href="../../api/org/omg/PortableServer/ServantLocatorOperations.html">
ServantLocator</a></code>
<P>When the POA has the <code>NON_RETAIN</code> policy, it uses servant managers that are 
<code>ServantLocators</code>. Because the POA knows that the servant
returned by this servant manager will be used only for a single request, it can supply extra 
information to the servant manager's operations and
the servant manager's pair of operations may be able to cooperate to do something different 
than a 
<code>ServantActivator</code>. When the POA uses the
<code>ServantLocator</code> interface, immediately after performing the operation invocation 
on the 
servant returned by preinvoke, the POA will invoke
postinvoke on the servant manager, passing the ObjectId value and the Servant value as 
parameters 
(among others). This feature may be used
to force every request for objects associated with a POA to be mediated by the servant 
manager. 
<P>This type is typically used to activate transient objects.
