<h2><a name="what"></a>What Is Java Plug-in?</h2>
<p>Java Plug-in extends the functionality of a web browser, allowing applets or 
  Java Beans to be run under Sun's Jave 2 runtime environment (JRE) rather than 
  the Java runtime environment that comes with the web browser. Java Plug-in is 
  part of Sun's JRE and is installed with it when the JRE is installed on a computer. 
  It works with both Netscape and Internet Explorer. </p>
<p>This functionality can be achieved in two different ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>By <a href="applet_tag.html">using the conventional <code>APPLET</code> 
    tag</a> in a web page.</li>
  <li>By replacing the <code>APPLET</code> tag with the <code>OBJECT</code> tag 
    for Internet Explorer; by replacing the <code>APPLET</code> tag with the <code>EMBED</code> 
    tag for Netscape 4. Note, however, that the <code>OBJECT</code> and <code>EMBED</code> 
    tags must conform to a special format as described in the next chapter, <i><a href="using_tags.html">Using 
    OBJECT, EMBED and APPLET Tags in Java Plug-in</a></i>.</li>
</ol>
<table summary="layout" width="90%" align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFCC" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <h2><u>Note:</u></h2>
      <p>Currently the <code>OBJECT</code> and <code>EMBED</code> tags do not 
        work with Netscape 6 with Java Plug-in. You must use the <code>APPLET</code> 
        tag with Netscape 6.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><code>OBJECT</code> and <code>EMBED</code> tags may be manually updated in 
  web pages, but to facilitate updating web pages to this special format, an HTML 
  Converter is provided. It is describe in the section called <i><a href="html_converter.html">Using 
  the HTML Converter to Convert Applet Tags for Java Plug-in</a></i>. </p>
<p>While the above constitutes the heart of Java Plug-in, there are many other 
  related topics that you may want to understand. For instance, you may want to 
  know how proxy configuration works in Java Plug-in, you may want to know what 
  protocols Java Plug-in supports, or you may want to know about cookie support 
  and caching. Such topics are included in <i>Part I: Java Plug-in Basics</i>. 
</p>
<p>You can determine some of the behavior of Java Plug-in and set options via 
  the Java Plug-in Control Panel. How you do this is also discussed in Part I 
  in the chapter called <i>Using the Java Plug-in Control Panel to Set Plug-in 
  Behavior/Options</i>.</p>
<p>Java Plug-in may be deployed in various ways&#151;on the Internet, within an 
  intranet, via Java Server Pages, etc. The various types and methods of deployments 
  are discussed in the <i>Part II: Deployment Schemes</i>. </p>
<p>Applets must be run in a secure environment, and various security topics are 
  discussed in the <i>Part III: Security</i>, including RSA signed applet verification. 
  As signing applets can be a difficult topic for novice applet developers, this 
  guide provides step-by-step instructions for signing applets in the chapter 
  called <a href="rsa_signing.html">How to Sign Applets Using RSA-Signed Certificates</a>. 
</p>
<p>Java Plug-in provides various kinds of debugging support for applets, and <i>Part 
  IV: Debugging Support</i> describes them. Java Debugger support is discussed. 
  So is the Java Plug-in Console, which includes various options that may be set 
  for debugging, including ones for tracing and logging.</p>
<p><i>Part V: Advanced Topics</i> discusses more esoteric matters such as supporting 
  multiple JREs in the same environment, Java-toJavaScript communication, how 
  to persist applets across browser sessions, special applet attributes for changing 
  the applet window background color, etc.</p>
<p>Finally, there are Appendices that information about Netscape 6; a FAQ; additional 
  information about the HTML Converter; and Microsoft VM versus Java 2 compatibility 
  issues.</p>
