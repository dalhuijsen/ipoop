<h2>Overview</h2>

Applications require preference and configuration data to adapt to 
the needs of different users and environments. 
The <a href="../../api/java/util/prefs/package-summary.html">java.util.prefs package</a> provides a way for applications to 
store and retrieve user and system preference and configuration data. 
The data is stored persistently in an implementation-dependent backing store. 
There are two separate trees of preference nodes, one for user
preferences and one for system preferences. 
<p>
All of the methods that modify preference data are permitted to operate
asynchronously.  They may return immediately, and changes will eventually
propagate to the persistent backing store.  
The <a href="../../api/java/util/prefs/Preferences.html#flush()">flush</a>
method can be used to force updates to the backing store.
<p>
The methods in the <a href="../../api/java/util/prefs/Preferences.html">Preferences class</a> may be invoked concurrently by multiple threads
in a single JVM without the need for external synchronization, and the
results will be equivalent to some serial execution.  If this class is used
concurrently by multiple JVMs that store their preference data in
the same backing store, the data store will not be corrupted, but no
other guarantees are made concerning the consistency of the preference
data.

<h3>Comparing Preferences API to Other Mechanisms</h3>
Prior to the introduction of the Preferences API, 
developers could choose to manage preference and configuration data in
an ad hoc fashion, by using the Properties API or the JNDI API as 
described below.
<p>
Often, preference and configuration data was stored
in properties files, accessed through the java.util.Properties
API.  However, there are no standards as to where such files should
reside on disk, or what they should be called.  Using this mechanism, it is 
extremely difficult to backup a user's preference data, or
transfer it from one machine to another. As the number of
applications increases, the possibility of file name conflicts
increases.  Also, this mechanism is of no help on platforms
that lack a local disk, or where it is desirable that the data
be stored in an external data store (such as an enterprise-wide
LDAP directory service). 
<p>
Less frequently, developers stored user preference and
configuration data in a directory service, accessed through the
Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) API. Unlike the Properties API,
JNDI allows the use of arbitrary data stores (back-end
neutrality). While JNDI is extremely powerful, it is also rather
large, consisting of 5 packages and 83 classes.  JNDI provides no
policy as to where in the directory name space the preference data should 
be stored, or in which name space. 
<p>
Neither Properties nor JNDI provide a simple, ubiquitous,
back-end neutral preferences management facility.  The Preferences API 
does provide such a facility, combining the simplicity of Properties
with the back-end neutrality of JNDI.  It provides
sufficient built-in policy to prevent name clashes, foster
consistency, and encourage robustness in the face of
inaccessibility of the backing data store.

<a name=prefs-usage-enclosing>
<h3>Obtaining Preferences Objects for an Enclosing Class</h3>
The following examples illustrate how you might obtain the Preferences
objects (system and user) pertaining to the enclosing class.  
These examples would work only inside instance methods.  
<p>
Note that static final fields, rather than inline String literals,
are used for the key names (<code>NUM_ROWS</code> and <code>NUM_COLS</code>). 
This reduces the likelihood of runtime bugs from typographical errors in key
names.
<p>
Note also that reasonable defaults are provided for each of the
preference values obtained.  These defaults will be returned if no preference
value has been set, or if the backing store is inaccessible.  
<a name=ex-enclosing>
<pre>
package com.acme.widget;
import  java.util.prefs.*;

public class Gadget {
    // Preference keys for this package
    private static final String NUM_ROWS = "num_rows";
    private static final String NUM_COLS = "num_cols";

    void foo() {
        Preferences prefs = Preferences.userNodeForPackage(this);

        int numRows = prefs.getInt(NUM_ROWS, 40);
        int numCols = prefs.getInt(NUM_COLS, 80);

        ...
    }
}
</pre>

The above example obtains per-user preferences.  If a single, per-system
value were desired, the first line in <tt>foo</tt> would be replaced by:
<pre>
        Preferences prefs = Preferences.systemNodeForPackage(this);
</pre>

<a name=prefs-usage-static>
<h3>Obtaining Preferences Objects for a Static Method</h3>

The examples in the prior section illustrate obtaining Preferences objects 
pertaining to the enclosing class, and work inside instance methods.  
In a static method (or static initializer), you need to explicitly
provide the name of the package :
<pre>
    Static String ourNodeName = "/com/acme/widget";

    static void foo() {
        Preferences prefs = Preferences.userRoot().node(ourNodeName);

        ...
    }
</pre>

It is always acceptable to obtain a system preferences object once, in a
static initializer, and use it whenever system preferences are required:
<pre>
    static Preferences prefs =  Preferences.systemRoot().node(ourNodeName);
</pre>

In general, it is acceptable to do the same thing for a user preferences
object, but not if the code in question is to be used in a server,
wherein multiple users will be running concurrently or serially.
In such a system, <code>userNodeForPackage</code> and <code>userRoot</code> 
will return the appropriate node for the calling user, thus it's critical
that calls to <code>userNodeForPackage</code> or <code>userRoot</code> 
be made from the appropriate thread at the appropriate time.  
If a piece of code may eventually be used in such a server environment, 
it is good, conservative practice to obtain user preferences objects 
immediately before they are used, as in the 
<a href=#ex-enclosing>prior example</a>.

<a name=prefs-usage-atomic>
<h3>Atomic Updates</h3>

The preferences API does not provide database like "transactions" wherein 
multiple preferences are modified atomically.  Occasionally, it is necessary 
to modify two or more preferences as a unit.  For example, suppose you are
storing the x and y coordinates where a window is to be placed.  The only
way to achieve atomicity is to store both values in a single preference.  
Many encodings are possible.  Here's a simple one:
<pre>
    int x, y;
    ...
    prefs.put(POSITION, x + "," + y);
</pre>
When such a "compound preference" is read, it must be decoded.  For
robustness, allowances should be made for a corrupt (unparseable) value:
<pre>
    static int X_DEFAULT = 50, Y_DEFAULT = 25;
    void baz() {
        String position = prefs.get(POSITION, X_DEFAULT + "," + Y_DEFAULT);
        int x, y;
        try {
            int i = position.indexOf(',');
            x = Integer.parseInt(coordinates.substring(0, i));
            y = Integer.parseInt(position.substring(i + 1));
        } catch(Exception e) {
            // Value was corrupt, just use defaults
            x = X_DEFAULT;
            y = Y_DEFAULT;
        }
        ...
    }
</pre>

<a name=prefs-usage-backingstore>
<h3>Determining Backing Store Status</h3>

Typical application code has no need to know whether the backing store is
available.  It should almost always be available, but if it isn't, the code
should continue to execute using default values in place of preference values
from the backing store.  Very rarely, some advanced program might want
to vary its behavior (or simply refuse to run) if the backing store were
unavailable. Following is a method that determines whether the backing store is
available by attempting to modify a preference value and flush the result
to the backing store.
<pre>
    private static final String BACKING_STORE_AVAIL = "BackingStoreAvail";

    private static boolean backingStoreAvailable() {
        Preferences prefs = Preferences.userRoot().node("<temporary>");
        try {
            boolean oldValue = prefs.getBoolean(BACKING_STORE_AVAIL, false);
            prefs.putBoolean(BACKING_STORE_AVAIL, !oldValue);
            prefs.flush();
        } catch(BackingStoreException e) {
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
</pre>

<a name=prefs-design-faq>
<h2>Design FAQ</h2>
Following is a collection of frequently asked questions concerning the
design of the Preferences API.
<ol>
<li><b>How does this Preferences API relate to Properties API? </b>
<p>
It is intended to replace most common uses of Properties,
rectifying many of its deficiencies, while retaining its light weight.  When
using Properties, the programmer must explicitly specify a pathname
for each properties file, but there is no standard location or naming
convention.  Properties files are "brittle", as they are hand-editable but
easily corrupted by careless editing.  Support for non-string data types in
properties is non-existent.  Properties cannot easily be used with a
persistence mechanism other than the file system.  In sum, the
Properties facility does not scale.
<p>
<li><b>How does Preferences API relate to JNDI?</b>

<p>Like JNDI, it provides back-end neutral access to persistent
key-value data.  JNDI, however, is far more powerful, and correspondingly
heavyweight.  JNDI is appropriate for enterprise applications that need its
power.  Preferences API is intended as a simple, ubiquitous, back-end neutral
preferences-management facility, enabling <b>any</b> Java application to
easily tailor its behavior to user preferences and maintain small amounts of
state from run to run.

<p>
<li><b>Why do all of the <code>get</code> methods require the caller to
pass in a default?</b>

<p>This forces the application authors to provide reasonable
default values, so that applications have a reasonable chance of running
even if the repository is unavailable. 

<p>
<li><b>How was it decided which methods should throw
<code>BackingStoreException</code>?</b>

<p>Only methods whose semantics absolutely require the ability to
communicate with the backing store throw this exception.  Typical
applications will have no need to call these methods.  As long as these
methods are avoided, applications will be able to run even if the backing
store is unavailable, which was an explicit design goal.

<p>
<li><b>Why doesn't this API provide stronger guarantees concerning
concurrent access by multiple VMs?  Similarly, why doesn't the API allow
multiple Preferences updates to be combined into a single  "transaction", with
all or nothing semantics?</b> 

<p>While the the API does provide rudimentary persistent data storage, it is
not intended as a substitute for a database.  It is critical that it be
possible to implement this API atop standard preference/configuration
repositories, most of which do not provide database-like
guarantees and functionality.  Such repositories have proven adequate 
for the purposes for which this API is intended.

<p>
<li><b>Why does this API have case-sensitive keys and node-names, while other
APIs playing in a similar space (such as the Microsoft Windows Registry 
and LDAP) do not?
</b>

<p>In the Java programming universe, case-sensitive String keys are
ubiquitous.  In particular, they are provided by the Properties class,
which this API is intended to replace.  It is not uncommon for people to use
Properties in a fashion that demands case-sensitivity.  For example,
Java package names (which are case-sensitive) are sometimes used as keys.  It
is recognized that this design decision complicates the life of the systems
programmer who implements Preferences atop a backing store
with case-insensitive keys, but this is considered an acceptable price to
pay, as far more programmers will use the Preferences API than will
implement it.

<p>
<li><b>Why doesn't this API use the Java 2 Collections Framework?</b>

<p>This API is designed for a very particular purpose, and is optimized
for that purpose.  In the absence of generic types (see 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/aboutJava/communityprocess/index.jsp">
JSR-14</a>), the API would be less convenient for typical users. 
It would lack compile-time type safety, if forced to conform to 
the <tt>Map</tt> API.  Also, it is not anticipated that interoperability 
with other Map implementations will be required (though it would be
straightforward to implement an adapter class if this assumption turned out to
be wrong).  Preferences API is, by design, so similar to
Map that programmers familiar with the latter should have no
difficulties using the former.  

<p>
<li><b>Why don't the put and remove methods return the old values?</b>

<p>It is desirable that both of these methods be executable even if 
the backing store is unavailable.  This would not be possible if they were
required to return the old value.  Further, it would have negative
performance impact if the API were implemented atop some common back-end
data stores. 

<p>
<li><b>Why does the API permit, but not require, stored defaults?</b>

<p>This functionality is required in enterprise settings for scalable,
cost-effective administration of preferences across the enterprise, but would
be overkill in a self-administered single-user setting.

<p>
<li><b>Why doesn't this API contain methods to read and write
arbitrary serializable objects?</b>

<p>Serialized objects are somewhat fragile: if the version of the
program that reads such a property differs from the version that wrote
it, the object may not deserialize properly (or at all).  It is not
impossible to store serialized objects using this API, but
we do not encourage it, and have not provided a convenience method.

<p>
<li><b>Why is <code>Preferences</code> an abstract class rather than an
interface?</b>

<p>It was decided that the ability to add new methods in an upward compatible
fashion outweighed the disadvantage that Preferences cannot be used
as a "mixin" (That is to say, arbitrary classes cannot also be made to serve as
Preferences objects.)  Also, this obviates the need for a separate
class for the static methods.  (Interfaces cannot contain static methods.)
