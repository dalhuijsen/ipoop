<h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>RSA-signed applets are supported to make deployment of signed applets easier. 
  However, signing applets through RSA is still difficult for most novice applet 
  developers and prevents them from taking full advantage of this Java Plug-in 
  feature. This document provides step-by-step instructions for signing applets 
  using RSA certificates, allowing novice applet developers to sign their applets 
  without having to wade through the many complex security issues involved.</p>
<p> To sign an applet, several things are required: 
<ol>
  <li>Signing tools.</li>
  <li>An RSA keypair and a certificate chain for the public keys.</li>
  <li>The applet and all its class files, bundled as JAR files.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="signing"></a>Signing Tools</h2>
<p> For RSA signing of applets, two types of signing tools are currently supported 
  in Java Plug-in: 
<ol>
  <li><i>Jarsigner</i>&#151;a tool that is shipped as part of the Java 2 SDK. 
    Command is <code>jarsigner ...</code><br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Netscape Signing Tool</i>&#151;a tool that is provided by Netscape for 
    signing applets in Navigator/Communicator. The latest version of the signing 
    tool may be download from <a href="http://developer.netscape.com/software/signedobj/jarpack.html">http://developer.netscape.com/software/signedobj/jarpack.html</a>. 
    (Note that Netscape no longer makes older versions of the signing tool available 
    for download.) Command is <code>signtool ...</code></li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="getting"></a>Getting RSA Certificates</h2>
<p> RSA certificates may be purchased from a Certificate Authority (CA) that supports 
  RSA, such as <a href="http://www.verisign.com">VeriSign</a> and <a href="http://www.thawte.com">Thawte</a>. 
  Some CAs, such as VeriSign, implement different protocols for issuing certificates, 
  depending on the particular signing tool you are using.</p>
<h3><a name="getting_jarsigner"></a>Getting Certificates With Jarsigner</h3>
<p> Jarsigner is known to work with VeriSign and Thawte certificates and may work 
  with Certificate Authorties. To use Jarsigner to sign applets using RSA certificates, 
  obtain the <a href="http://www.verisign.com/products/signing/index.html">Sun 
  Java Signing</a> certificate from VeriSign or the <a href="http://www.thawte.com/html/SUPPORT/devel/jdk.html">Java 
  Code Signing</a> certificate from Thawte&#151;or similar certificates from other 
  CAs. During the process of certificate enrollment, you will be asked to provide 
  the certificate signing request (CSR). To generate the CSR, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Use <code>keytool</code> to generate an RSA keypair (using the &quot;<code>-genkey 
    -keyalg rsa</code>" options). Make sure your distinguished name contains all 
    the components mandated by VeriSign/Thawte. E.g., 
    <pre>
C:\>C:\jdk1.3\bin\keytool -genkey -keyalg rsa -alias MyCert
Enter keystore password: *********
What is your first and last name?
[Unknown]: XXXXXXX YYY
What is the name of your organizational unit?
[Unknown]: Java Software
What is the name of your organization?
[Unknown]: Sun Microsystems
What is the name of your City or Locality?
[Unknown]: Cupertino
What is the name of your State or Province?
[Unknown]: CA
What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
[Unknown]: US
Is &lt;CN=XXXXXXX YYY, OU=Java Software, O=Sun Microsystems,
                L=Cupertino, ST=CA, C=US&gt; correct?
[no]: yes

Enter key password for &lt;MyCert&gt;
(RETURN if same as keystore password): *********
</pre>
  </li>
  <li> Use "<code>keytool -certreq</code>" to generate a certification signing 
    request. Copy the result and paste it into the VeriSign/Thawte webform. For 
    example,&nbsp; 
    <pre>
C:\&gt;C:\jdk1.3\bin\keytool -certreq -alias MyCert
Enter keystore password:&nbsp; *********

</pre>
  </li>
  <li>The CA (e.g., VeriSign/Thawte) will send you a certificate reply (chain) 
    by email. Copy the chain and store it in a file. Use "<code>keytool -import</code>" 
    to import the chain into your keystore. E.g., 
    <pre>C:\&gt;C:\jdk1.3\bin\keytool -import -alias MyCert -file VSSStanleyNew.cer 
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Your RSA certificate and its supporting chain have been validated and imported 
    into your keystore. You are now ready to use <code>jarsigner</code> to sign 
    your JAR file.</li>

    </td>
  </tr>

<h3><a name="getting_netscape"></a>Getting Certificates With Netscape Signing 
  Tool</h3>
<p> Most CAs (e.g., VeriSign/Thawte) support Netscape Signing Tool. To use the 
  Netscape Signing Tool to sign applets using RSA certificates, obtain the <a href="http://www.verisign.com/products/signing/index.html">Netscape 
  Object Signing</a> certificate from Verisign or the <a href="http://www.thawte.com/html/SUPPORT/devel/nsobjectsign.html">Netscape 
  Object Signing</a> certificate from Thawte&#151;or similar certificates from 
  other CAs. During the process of enrollment, you will be asked for personal/company 
  information, since the CA will need to verify your identity before issuing a 
  certificate. This process may take from several hours to several days.</p>
<p> Once the RSA certificate is issued, it usually consists of three files:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>cert7.db</code></li>
  <li><code>key3.db</code></li>
  <li><code>secmod.db</code></li>
</ul>
<p> Depending on the CA, the certificate may be issued and stored on a floppy 
  diskette, or it may be stored directly in the security modules of Netscape Navigator/Communicator. 
  Once you have the certificate, you are ready to use the Netscape Signing Tool 
  to sign your JAR file.&nbsp;</p>
<h2> <a name="bundling"></a>Bundling Java Applets as JAR Files</h2>
<p> To use Jarsigner to sign applets with RSA certificates, the applets must be 
  bundled as JAR files. The Jar tool (command <code>jar ...</code>), which comes 
  wiht the Java 2 SDK, can be used for that purpose. E.g.,</p>
<pre>C:&gt;C:\jdk1.3\bin\jar cvf C:\TestApplet.jar . 
added manifest
adding: TestApplet.class (in = 94208) (out= 20103)(deflated 78%)
adding: TestHelper.class (in = 16384) (out= 779)(deflated 95%)
</pre>
This example creates a JAR file C:\TestApplet.jar, and it contains all the files 
under the current directory and its sub-directories. 
<p> After the JAR file is created, you should verify its content using the <code>jar</code> 
  tool again, e.g.,</p>
<pre>C:&gt;C:\jdk1.3\bin\jar tvf TestApplet.jar 
     0 Mon Mar 06 18:02:54 PST 2000 META-INF/
    68 Mon Mar 06 18:02:54 PST 2000 META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
 94208 Wed Mar 10 11:48:52 PST 2000 TestApplet.class
 16384 Wed Mar 10 11:48:52 PST 2000 TestHelper.class
</pre>
This ensures that the class files are stored with the proper path within the JAR 
file. 
<p> To sign an applet with an RSA certificate using the Netscape Signing Tool, 
  the applet must be placed in a directory, e.g., <code>C:\signdir</code>. The 
  Netscape Signing Tool will bundle it as JAR file after the signing process.</p>
<h2> <a name="signing_applets"></a>Signing Java Applets</h2>
<p> Once you have the RSA certificates, the signing tool and the applet's JAR 
  files, you are ready to sign the applets. 
<h3><a name="signing_jarsigner"></a>Signing applets using <code>jarsigner</code></h3>
<p> To sign applets using <code>jarsigner</code>, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Use <code>jarsigner</code> to sign the JAR file, using the RSA credentials 
    in your keystore that were generated in the previous steps. Make sure the 
    same alias name is specified. E.g., 
    <pre>C:\&gt;C:\jdk1.3\bin\jarsigner C:\TestApplet.jar MyCert
Enter Passphrase for keystore: ********
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Use &quot;<code>jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs</code>&quot; to verify 
    the jar files 
    <pre>C:&gt;C:\jdk1.3\bin\jarsigner -verify -verbose 
                -certs d:\TestApplet.jar

<p>Your applet has been signed properly. You are now ready to deploy your RSA 
  signed applet. See <a href="rsa_deploying.html">How to Deploy RSA Signed Applets</a> 
  for deployment information.</p>
<h2><a name="converting"></a>Converting Old Netscape-Signed Applets</h2>
<p> Existing RSA signed applets designed for Netscape may use Netscape-specific 
  security APIs. These Netscape-specific APIs are not supported in Java Plug-in. 
  Instead, the Plug-in supports the standard Java security APIs in both Netscape 
  Navigator and Internet Explorer. 
<p> 
<p>To migrate Netscape-signed applets using the Netscape security APIs to run 
  in Java Plug-in:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Comment or remove all <code>netscape.security<em>.*</em></code> related 
    statements from the Java applet.</li>
  <li>Compile and archive the applet as a JAR file.</li>
  <li>Re-sign the JAR file using Object Signing.</li>
</ol>
<p>This ensures that an RSA signed applet will run in both Netscape Navigator 
  and Internet Explorer with Java Plug-in.</p>
<h2><a name="authenticode"></a>Microsoft Authenticode</h2>
Authenticode is a proprietary signing technology used in Microsoft Internet Explorer 
on Win32 for supporting signed applets in IE's JVM. Authenticode is not supported 
in Java Plug-in. Instead, the Java Plug-in supports use of RSA signed applets 
in both IE and Netscape.
<h2><a name="common"></a>Common Problems</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If the JAR file is not signed properly, if the RSA certificate has expired, 
    or if the RSA certificate is a self-generated, self-signed certificate, Java 
    Plug-in may fail silently and not pop up the security dialog. The applet will 
    be treated as unsigned.<br>
  <li>The Netscape Signing Tool is very particular about JAR file format. In Netscape 
    Signing Tool, it expects the MANIFEST file to be at the end of the JAR file, 
    whereas Jarsigner puts it at the beginning. The standard does not mandate 
    where the MANIFEST file should be in the JAR file. Therefore, if you create 
    a JAR file using Jar tool, the Netscape Signing Tool may complain about &quot;Invalid 
    Jar File Format&quot;. On the other hand, Jarsigner is not picky; it can verify 
    a JAR file regardless of whether its MANIFEST file is located at the beginning 
    or the end. To avoid this problem when using Netscape Signing Tool, you should 
    both generate and sign the JAR file through the Netscape Signing Tool.<br>
</ul>
