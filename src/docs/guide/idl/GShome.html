IDL is a technology for distributed objects--that is, objects
interacting on different platforms across a network. Java IDL enables 
objects to interact regardless of whether they're
written in the Java programming language or another language such as
C, C++, COBOL, or others.
<P>
This is possible because Java IDL is based on the Common Object Request
Brokerage Architecture (CORBA), an industry-standard distributed object
model. A key feature of CORBA is IDL, a language-neutral Interface
Definition Language. Each language that supports CORBA has its own IDL
mapping--and as its name implies, Java IDL supports the mapping for
Java. To learn more about the IDL-to-Java language mapping, see <a 
href="mapping/jidlMapping.html">IDL-to-Java Language Mapping</a>.
<P>
To support interaction between objects in separate programs, Java IDL
provides an Object Request Broker, or ORB. The ORB is a class library
that enables low-level communication between Java IDL applications and
other CORBA-compliant applications.

<P>
This tutorial teaches the basic tasks needed to build a CORBA distributed
application using Java IDL. You will build the classic "Hello World"
program as a distributed application. The Hello World program has a single 
operation that returns a string to be printed.
<p>

Any relationship between distributed objects has two sides: the client
and the server. The server provides a remote interface, and the client
calls a remote interface. These relationships are common to most
distributed object standards, including Java Remote Method Invocation (<a 
href="../rmi/index.html">RMI</a>, <a 
href="../rmi-iiop/index.html">RMI-IIOP</a>) and <a 
href="http://www.omg.org/corba/">CORBA</a>. Note that in
this context, the terms client and server define object-level rather
than application-level interaction--any application could be a server
for some objects and a client of others. In fact, a single object could
be the client of an interface provided by a remote object and at the
same time implement an interface to be called remotely by other
objects.
<P>
This figure shows how a one-method distributed object is shared between
a CORBA client and server to implement the classic
&quot;Hello World&quot; application.

</center>
<P>
On the client side, the application includes a reference for the remote
object. The object reference has a stub method, which is a stand-in for
the method being called remotely. The stub is actually wired into the
ORB, so that calling it invokes the ORB's connection capabilities,
which forwards the invocation to the server.
<P>
On the server side, the ORB uses skeleton code to translate the remote
invocation into a method call on the local object. The skeleton
translates the call and any parameters to their implementation-specific
format and calls the method being invoked. When the method returns, the
skeleton code transforms results or errors, and sends them back to the
client via the ORBs.
<P>
Between the ORBs, communication proceeds by means of a shared protocol,
IIOP--the Internet Inter-ORB Protocol. IIOP, which is based on the
standard TCP/IP internet protocol, defines how CORBA-compliant ORBs
pass information back and forth. Like CORBA and IDL, the IIOP standard
is defined by OMG, the Object Management Group.


<h2>
The Java IDL Development Process and the Hello World Tutorial
</h2>
This tutorial teaches the basic tasks in building a CORBA distributed
application using Java IDL. You will build the classic "Hello World"
program as a distributed application. The "Hello World" program has a 
single operation that returns a string to be printed. 

<P>
Despite its simple design, the Hello World program lets you learn and
experiment with all the tasks required to develop almost any CORBA
program that uses static invocation.

The following steps provide a general guide to designing and developing a 
distributed object application with Java IDL.  Links to the relevant steps 
of the tutorial will guide you through creating this sample application. 

<p>
<OL>
<li>Define the remote interface
<p>
You define the interface for the remote object using the OMG's
Interface Definition Langauge (IDL). You use IDL instead of the Java 
language because the <CODE CLASS="Code">idlj</CODE>
compiler automatically maps from IDL, generating all Java language
stub and skeleton source files, along with the infrastructure code for
connecting to the ORB. Also, by using IDL, you make it possible for
developers to implement clients and servers in any other
CORBA-compliant language.
<P>
Note that if you're implementing a client for an existing CORBA
service, or a server for an existing client, you would get the IDL
interfaces from the implementer--such as a service provider or vendor.
You would then run the <CODE CLASS="Code">idlj</CODE>
compiler over those interfaces and follow these steps.
<p>
<B><A href="tutorial/GSIDL.html">Writing the IDL file</A></B> in this 
tutorial walks you through defining the remote interface for the simple 
"Hello World" example.
<p>

<li>Compile the remote interface
<p>
When you run the <CODE CLASS="Code">idlj</CODE> compiler over your 
interface definition file, it generates the Java version of the interface, 
as well as the class code files for the stubs and skeletons that enable 
your applications to hook into the ORB.
</p>
<p><B><A href="tutorial/GSIDL.html#compiling">Mapping Hello.idl to 
Java</A></B> in this tutorial walks you through these steps for the simple 
"Hello World" example.
<p>

<li>Implement the server
<p>
Once you run the <code>idlj</code> compiler, you can use the skeletons it 
generates to put together your server application.  In addition to 
implementing the methods of the remote interface, your server code 
includes a mechanism to start the ORB and wait for invocation from a 
remote client.
</p>
<p>
<B><A href="tutorial/GSserver.html">Developing the Hello World 
Server</A></B> walks you through writing a simple server for the "Hello 
World" application.
<p>

<li>Implement the client
<p>
Similarly, you use the stubs generated by the
<CODE CLASS="Code">idlj</CODE>
compiler as the basis of your client application. The client code
builds on the stubs to start its ORB, look up the server using the name
service provided with Java IDL, obtain a reference for the remote
object, and call its method.
</p>
<p>
<B><A href="tutorial/GSapp.html">Developing a Client Application</A></B> 
walks you through writing a simple client application.
<p>

<li>Start the applications
<p>
Once you implement a server and a client, you can start the name
service, then start the server, then run the client.
</p>
<p>
<B><A href="tutorial/GScompile.html">Running the Hello World 
Application</A></B> walks you through running the server and 
client program that together make up the "Hello World" application, and 
the name service that enables them to find one another.
 
</OL>
</p>
<p>
<B><A href="tutorial/GSstring.html">Using Stringified Object 
References</A></B> walks you through making an object reference when there 
is no naming service. 

<P><STRONG><a href="tutorial/jidl2machines.html">Running the Hello World 
Application on Two Machines</a></STRONG> describes one way of distributing 
the simple application across two machines - a client and a server.
