  The JNLP file format has not changed between the 1.0 and this release. </p>
<p>If your JNLP file is compatible with a version of Java Web Start that is lower 
  than 1.0, please note that the JNLP file format has changed significantly.&nbsp; 
  Below is a list of the most common modifications that needs to be applied to 
  a 0.4 JNLP file to make it compatible with Java Web Start 1.0 or higher: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Set <tt>spec</tt> attribute to 1.0.</li>
  <li> Rename the <tt>unrestricted</tt> element to <tt>all-permissions</tt>.</li>
  <li> Rename the <tt>jre</tt> element to <tt>j2se</tt> and move this element 
    inside the <tt>resources</tt> element (i.e., make <tt>j2se</tt> a subelement 
    of <tt>resources</tt>).</li>
</ul>
<p> Converting JNLP files used with the 1.0-beta or 1.0-rc release only requires 
  updating the <tt>spec</tt> attribute to "1.0". </p>
