<h2><a name="deploy"></a>How to Deploy RSA Signed Applets </h2>
<p>To deploy RSA signed applets:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Reference the JAR from the HTML page using <code>archive</code>, <code>cache_archive</code>, 
    or <code>cache_archive_ex</code> format. See <a href="applet_caching.html">Applet 
    Caching</a>.
  <li>Place the JAR file and HTML page on the web server. 
</ol>
<p>When users of Java Plug-in encounter an RSA signed applet, the Plug-in will 
  verify whether: </p>
<ol>
  <li>the applet is correctly signed</li>
  <li>the RSA certificate chain and root CA are valid </li>
</ol>
<p>If both verify positive, the Plug-in will pop-up a security dialog telling 
  the user and providing four options:</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Grant always</em>: If selected, the applet will be granted the <code>AllPermission</code> 
    permission. Any applet signed with the same certificate will be trusted automatically 
    in the future, and no security dialog will pop up when the certificate is 
    encountered again. This option selection can be changed from the Java Plug-in 
    Control Panel.<br>
  </li>
  <li><em>Grant this session</em>: If selected, the applet will be granted the 
    <code>AllPermission</code> permission. Any applet signed with the same certificate 
    will be trusted automatically within the same browser session.<br>
  </li>
  <li><em>Deny</em>: If selected, the applet will be treated as untrusted.<br>
  </li>
  <li><em>View Issuer</em>: If selected, the user can examine the attributes of 
    each certificate in the certificate chain in the JAR file.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the user selects the options from the security dialog, the applet will 
  be run in the corresponding security context. Note that all options are selected 
  on the fly; no preconfiguration is required.</p>
<p></p>
<h2><a name="certificate"></a>Certificate Management</h2>
<p>The Java Plug-in Control Panel provides a <a href="control_panel.html#certificates">Certificates 
  Panel</a> for managing RSA signed applets. This panel contains a list of certificates 
  that received &quot;<em>Grant always</em>&quot; permission when the Java Plug-in 
  security dialog (pop-up) ran. Users can remove any certificate from the list, 
  and if an applet signed by a removed certificates is encountered again, a security 
  dialog pop-up will appear asking for permission. Users can also export and view 
  certificates through the control Panel.</p>
<h2><a name="disabling"></a>Disabling RSA Signed Applet Support</h2>
<p>RSA signed applets can be entirely disabled in Java Plug-in by specifying the 
  <code>usePolicy</code> permission in the policy file. If the <code>usePolicy</code> 
  permission is among the permissions granted to the given codesource (by the 
  configured security policy), user prompting will not take place, and only permissions 
  specified in the security policy will be granted to the codesource. By default, 
  RSA signed applets are enabled in the Java Plug-in. </p>
