<h3><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>Developing applications for deployment with Java Web Start is generally the 
  same as developing stand-alone applications for the Java 2 platform. For instance, 
  the entry point for the application is the standard <tt>public static void main(String[] 
  argv)</tt>. </p>
<p>However, in order to support Web deployment&#8212;automatic download and launching 
  of an application&#8212;and to ensure that an application can run in a secure 
  sandbox, there are some additional considerations: </p>
<ul>
  <li> An application must be delivered as a set of JAR files.</li>
  <li>All application resources, such as files and images must be stored in JAR 
    files; and they must be referenced using the <tt>getResource</tt> mechanism 
    in the Java 2 platform (see below).</li>
  <li>If an application is written to run in a secure sandbox, it must follow 
    these restrictions: 
    <ul>
      <li> No access to local disk.</li>
      <li> All JAR files must be downloaded from the same host.</li>
      <li> Network connections are enabled only to the host from which the JAR 
        files are downloaded.</li>
      <li> No security manager can be installed.</li>
      <li> No native libraries may be used.</li>
      <li>Limited access to system properties. The application has read/write 
        access to all system properties defined in the JNLP File, as well as read-only 
        access to the same set of properties that an Applet has access to. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>An application is allowed to use the <tt>System.exit</tt> call. &nbsp; </li>
  <li> An application that needs unrestricted access to the system will need to 
    be delivered in a set of signed JAR files. All entries in each JAR file must 
    be signed.</li>
</ul>
<h3> <a name="retrieving"></a>Retrieving Resources from JAR files</h3>
<p>Java Web Start only transfers JAR files from the Web server to the client machine. 
  It determines where to store the JAR files on the local machine. Thus, an application 
  cannot use disk-relative references to resources such as images and configuration 
  files. </p>
<p>All application resources must be retrieved from the JAR files specified in 
  the <tt>resources</tt> section of the JNLP file, or retrieved explicitly using 
  an HTTP request to the Web server. Storing resources in JAR files is recommended, 
  since they will be cached on the local machine by Java Web Start. </p>
<p>The following code example shows how to retrieve images from a JAR file: </p>
<p><b><tt><font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#000000">// Get current 
  classloader</font></font></tt></b> <br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; ClassLoader cl = <b>this</b>.getClass().getClassLoader();</tt> 
  <br>
  <b><tt><font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#000000">// Create icons</font></font></tt></b> 
  <br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Icon saveIcon&nbsp; = <b>new </b>ImageIcon(cl.getResource("images/save.gif"));</tt> 
  <br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; Icon cutIcon&nbsp;&nbsp; = <b>new </b>ImageIcon(cl.getResource("images/cut.gif"));</tt> 
  <br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt> </p>
<p>The example assumes that the following entries exist in one of the JAR files 
  for the application: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>images/save.gif</tt> <br>
    <tt>images/cut.gif</tt> </p>
</blockquote>
<h3> <a name="security"></a>Security and Code Signing</h3>
<p>Java Web Start addresses the security issues: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Protecting users against malicious code (intentional &amp; unintentional) 
    that may affect local files;</li>
  <li>Protecting enterprises against code that may attempt to access or destroy 
    data on networks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Applications launched with Java Web Start are, by default, run in a restricted 
  environment where they have limited access to local computing resources, such 
  as storage devices and the local network. In this sandbox environment, Java 
  Web Start can guarantee that a downloaded and potentially untrusted application 
  cannot compromise the security of the local files or the network. </p>
<p>An additional security feature supported by Java Web Start is digital code 
  signing. If an application being invoked is delivered in one or more signed 
  JAR files, Java Web Start will verify that the contents of the JAR file have 
  not been modified since they were signed. If verification of a digital signature 
  fails, Java Web Start will not run the application, since it may have been compromised 
  by a third-party. </p>
<p>The support for code signing is important for both users and for application 
  service providers. This service makes it possible for users to verify that an 
  application comes from a trusted source. Because the application service provider 
  signs the code, both can be ensured that no other party can impersonate the 
  application on the Web. A signed application that is trusted by the user can 
  also request additional system privileges, such as access to a local disk. </p>
<p>Java Web Start presents a dialog displaying the application's origin, based 
  on the signer's certificate, before the application is launched. This allows 
  the user to make an informed decision about whether or not to grant additional 
  privileges to the downloaded code. </p>
<p>By including the following settings in the JNLP file, an application can request 
  full access to a client system if all its JAR files are signed : </p>
<p><tt>&lt;<b>security</b>></tt> <br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;<b>all-permissions</b>/></tt> <br>
  <tt>&lt;/<b>security</b>></tt> </p>
<p>The implementation of code signing in Java Web Start is based on the security 
  API in the core Java 2 Platform. The Java 2 SE JRE 1.4.2 supports code signing 
  with the SHA1withDSA and MD5withRSA algorithms.</p>
<p>Developers sign code for use with Java Web Start in the same way as for Java 
  Applets&#8212;by using the standard <tt>jarsigner</tt> tool from the Java 2 
  SE SDK. The <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/tooldocs/tools.html">documentation</a> 
  for the <tt>jarsigner</tt> tool provides examples of how to sign code and create 
  test certificates, and it discusses other issues related to signing. </p>
<p>Java Web Start also supports use of the Netscape <tt>signtool</tt> used with 
  SDK/JRE 1.4.2. See the Netscape Web site for details: <a href="http://developer.netscape.com/software/signedobj/">http://developer.netscape.com/software/signedobj/</a></p>
<h3> <a name="signing"></a>Signing JAR Files With a Test Certificate</h3>
<p>Here are the steps needed to sign a JAR file with a test certificate: </p>
<p> 1. Make sure that you have an SDK 1.4.2 <code>keytool</code> and <code>jarsigner</code> 
  in your path. These tools are located in the SDK bin directory.</p>
<p> 2. Create a new key in a new <code>keystore</code> as follows: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><tt>keytool -genkey -keystore myKeystore -alias myself</tt> </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>You will get prompted for a information about the new key, such as password, 
    name, etc. This will create the <code>myKeystore</code> file on disk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> 3. Then create a self-signed test certificate as follows: </p>
<ol>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><tt>keytool -selfcert -alias myself -keystore myKeystore</tt> </p>
  </blockquote>
</ol>
<blockquote> 
  <p>This will prompt for the password. Generating the certificate may take a 
    few minutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> 4. Check to make sure that everything is okay. To list the contents of the 
  keystore, use this command: </p>
<ol>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><tt>keytool -list -keystore myKeystore</tt> </p>
  </blockquote>
</ol>
<blockquote> 
  <p>It should list something like: </p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><tt> Keystore type: jks<br>
      Keystore provider: SUN<br>
      <br>
      Your keystore contains 1 entry:<br>
      <br>
      myself, Tue Jan 23 19:29:32 PST 2001, keyEntry,<br>
      Certificate fingerprint (MD5):<br>
      C2:E9:BF:F9:D3:DF:4C:8F:3C:5F:22:9E:AF:0B:42:9D</tt> </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>5. Finally, sign the JAR file with the test certificate as follows: </p>
<ol>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><tt>jarsigner -keystore myKeystore test.jar myself</tt> </p>
  </blockquote>
</ol>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Repeat this step with all of your JAR files.</p>
  </blockquote>
<p> <br>
  Note that a self-signed test certificate should only be used for internal testing, 
  since it does not guarantee the identity of the user and therefore cannot be 
  trusted. A trust-worthy certificate can be obtained from a certificate authority, 
  such as <a href="http://www.verisign.com">VeriSign</a> or <a href="http://www.thawte.com">Thawte</a>, 
  and should be used when the application is put into production. </p>
<h3> <a name="how"></a>How to Encode JNLP Files</h3>
<p>Beginning with Java Web Start version 1.2, JNLP files may be encoded in any 
  character encoding supported by the J2SE platform. (See the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/intl/encoding.doc.html">J2SE 
  documentation</a> for a list of supported encodings.) </p>
<p> To encode a JNLP file, specify an encoding in the XML prolog of that file. 
  For example, the following line indicates that the JNLP file will be encoded 
  in UTF-16. </p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The XML prolog itself must be UTF-8-encoded.</p>
<h3><a name="dynamic"></a>Dynamic Download of HTTPS Certificates</h3>
<p>Beginning with 1.4.2, Java Web Start dynamically imports certificates in much 
  the same way as browsers do. In order to make this work, Java Web Start now 
  sets its own https handler, using the <code>java.protocol.handler.pkgs</code> 
  system properties, to initialize defaults for <code>SSLSocketFactory</code> 
  and <code>HostnameVerifier</code>. It sets the defaults with <code>HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultSSLSocketFactory</code> 
  and <code>HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultHostnameVerifier</code>. </p>
<p>If your application uses those two method, make sure they are called after 
  the Java Web Start https handler is initialized, otherwise your custom handler 
  will be replaced by the Java Web Start default handler. You can ensure that 
  your own customized <code>SSLSocketFactory</code> and <code>HostnameVerifiter</code> 
  are used by doing either of the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Installing your own https handler, which will completely replace the Java 
    Web Start https handler (for more information, see <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/onlineTraining/protocolhandlers/">A 
    New Era for Java Protocol Handlers</a>);</li>
  <li> Calling <code>HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultSSLSocketFactory</code> or <code>HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultHostnameVerifier</code> 
    only after the first https url object is created, which will execute the Java 
    Web Start https handler initialization code first.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
