<h2><a name="http"></a>HTTP, FTP, and GOPHER </h2>
<p>Java Plug-in supports HTTP, FTP, and GOPHER protocols, including built-in proxy 
  configuration support.</p>
<h2><a name="https"></a>HTTPS</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>HTTPS is supported in Java Plug-in through Java Secure Socket Extension (JSEE), 
  which provides a Java implementation of SSL and HTTPS for the Java platform. 
</p>
<h3>Error handling support </h3>
<p>When accessing an HTTPS server, errors may occur. Java Plug-in has hooked into 
  JSSE to provide the following types of error handling: </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Hostname mismatch:</i> If the HTTPS server host name does not match the 
    name on the server certificate, a warning dialog will appear.&nbsp;<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Untrusted server certificate:</i> If the server certificate can not be 
    verified during the SSL handshaking, a warning dialog will appear.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Untrusted client certificate:</i> In case client authentication is required 
    by the server and the client certificate cannot be verified, a warning dialog 
    will be appear.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Server authentication:</i> If the client accesses a protected directory 
    on the HTTPS server, the users will be prompted for a username and password. 
    <font size="4"> <b>Note:</b></font> Only basic authentication is currently 
    supported. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Potential issues with HTTPS through JSSE </h3>
<p>Although support of HTTPS through JSSE eliminates many browser-specific problems, 
  there are several issues that developers should be aware of: </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Untrusted server certificate: </i>When SSL handshaking takes place in 
    establishing an HTTPS connection, the server certificate is verified against 
    the root CA store in J2SE. However, J2SE supports fewer root CA certificates 
    than does the browser. As a result, you may have problems with untrusted server 
    certificates.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Client authentication:</i> An HTTPS server may require client authentication, 
    in which case a local client certificate is sent to the server for authentication. 
    In JSSE, client certificates are stored in a separate file and are independent 
    of the browser. In order for client authentication to work, developers must 
    import client certificates into JSSE through the keytool. See the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsse/">JSSE 
    documentation</a> for more information.<br>
  </li>
  <li><i>Level of error handling:</i> Java Plug-in currently handles the types 
    of error listed in the previous section. However, if there are additional 
    types of error that Java Plug-in doesn't recognize, the Java applet code may 
    break.&nbsp;<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="socks"></a>Socks</h2>
<p>Java Plug-in currently supports SOCKS version 4. </p>
<p><b><font size="4">Note:</font></b> For HTTP/HTTPS, a SOCKS proxy server may 
  be used with a web proxy server to add caching. The behavior, however, may differ 
  from that observed when running a similar configuration in a browser without 
  Java Plug-in.</p>
<h2><a name="ntlm"></a>NTLM Authentication</h2>
<p>Java Plug-in supports NTLM authentication protocol for HTTP/HTTPS. When attempting 
  to access a server requiring NTLM authentication, the user will be presented 
  with a dialog requesting two items (fields) of information: username and password. 
  If the user's domain is the same as the domain of the server to be accessed, 
  only username and passwork need be entered. But when the domain of the user 
  is different from that of the server, then the domain of the server must be 
  entered as well. It should be entered in the username field with a separating 
  backslash (<code>\</code>) as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>&lt;domain&gt;\&lt;username&gt;</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>password is entered as it normally is in the password field.</p>
