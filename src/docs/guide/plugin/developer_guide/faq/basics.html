<p><b>Q: What is Java Plug-in Software?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>Java Plug-in Software is a software product from Sun Microsystems, 
  Inc., that allows enterprise web managers to direct Java applets and JavaBeans<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> 
  components on their intranet web pages to run using Sun's Java Runtime Environment 
  (JRE). With the 1.4 release of Java Plug-in, it is also allows the conventional 
  APPLET tag to direct Java applets to use Sun's JRE. This is especially useful 
  in browser, such Internet Explorer 6, that do not support Java.
<p><b>Q: For whom is Java Plug-in Software intended?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>Java Plug-in Software is designed for enterprise customers who want 
  to deploy Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition based applets on their intranet web pages, 
  and support Microsoft Windows-, Solaris-, and Linux-based browsers in their 
  enterprise. With the 1.4 release, it is also designed for the consumer who wants 
  to run Java applets on a web page.
<p><b>Q: Is there documentation available for Java Plug-in Software?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>To assist in your deployment of Java Plug-in Software, Sun has made 
  available a variety of technical documentation. Documentation regarding the 
  HTML specifications, using Java Plug-in Software in intranet environments, how 
  proxy configuration works, how to script applets, and much more are available 
  from the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/plugin/">Java Plug-in 
  Software documentation page</a>. For the consumer-oriented product that uses 
  conventional APPLET tag support, you may also want to visit the <a href="http://java.sun.com/getjava/">Get 
  Java Technology</a> page and see the documentation available there.
<p><b>Q: What features does Java Plug-in Software offer? </b> 
<p><b>A: </b>Java Plug-in Software delivers several key capabilities to for users 
  of Internet Explorer or Netscape's Navigator<sup></sup>: 
<p> 
<ul>
  <li>Full Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition</li>
  <li>Full Java Compatible<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> support</li>
  <li>Future-ready architecture</li>
  <li>Free public download and easy install</li>
  <li>Free Java Plug-in Software HTML Converter</li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Q: What is the advantage of downloading and using Java Plug-in Software 
  rather than the browser's default Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> virtual 
  machine? </b> 
<p><b>A: </b>Using Java Plug-in Software allows enterprises and consumers to: 
<ol>
  <li> Take full advantage of Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition functionality such 
    as JavaBeans, JNI<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup>, and RMI today.</li>
  <li> Develop and deploy 100% Pure Java<sup><font size=-2>SM</font></sup> applets 
    on Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator browsers, and be assured that 
    they will run reliably and consistently in both browsers.</li>
  <li> Be assured that they will receive support for the latest releases of Sun's 
    Java 2 platform --including the high-performance Java HotSpot<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> 
    virtual machine--in Internet Explorer and Navigator as soon as Sun releases 
    them.</li>
  <li>Run applets in web browsers that no longer support Java.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Q: Is Java Plug-in Software included in the Java 2 Software Development 
  Kit (SDK), Standard Edition?</b> 
<p><b>A:</b> Yes. 
<p><b>Q: Does Java Plug-in Software work on platforms other than Microsoft Windows 
  or Solaris (for example, Mac OS, AIX, Linux, HP-UX, etc.) versions of IE or 
  Navigator?</b> 
<p><b>A:</b> Sun has made Java Plug-in Software available for porting to all operating 
  system providers. For information about support for Java Plug-in Software on 
  other operating systems, contact the operating system provider. 
<p><b>Q: What information should I provide when reporting a bug to <a href="http://java.sun.com/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi">http://java.sun.com/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi</a>

    required to reproduce the problem.</li>
</ol>
<h2><b><font size=+1><a name="features"></a></font>Supported Features</b> </h2>
<p><b>Q: Does Java Plug-in Software offer support for all the features in Java 
  2 SDK, Standard Edition?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>Yes. Java Plug-in Software uses the same JRE that users can download 
  from Sun's web site today <nobr><wbr>(see <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/"> 
  http://java.sun.com/j2se/</a>)</nobr>. 
<p><b>Q: Is Java Plug-in Software fully compliant with the JCK (Java Compatibility 
  Kit) test suite for Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>Java Plug-in Software is fully compliant with the JCK test suite 
  for Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition. 
<p><b>Q: What browsers and operating systems does Java Plug-in support?&nbsp; 
  </b> 
<p><b>A: </b>See <a href="../overview.html#supported">Supported Operating Systems 
  and Browsers</a>.
<p><b>Q: Does Java Plug-in Software support scripting?&nbsp;</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>Java Plug-in Software supports scripting of applets in Internet Explorer 
  and Netscape 6. However, scripting is not available when using Java Plug-in 
  Software in Navigator 4.
<p><b>Q: Does Java Plug-in Software support signed applets?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>Yes, Java Plug-in Software supports standard Java 2 SDK, Standard 
  Edition signed JARs and applets signed using Netscape signing tools. See the 
  <a href="../rsa_signing.html">How to Sign Applets Using RSA-Signed Certificates</a> 
  for more details. 
<p><b>Q: Does Java Plug-in Software automatically recognize and use the proxy 
  server configuration that the browser was using?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>It can. There are in fact three options beginning with the 1.4 release. 
  See <a href="../proxie_config.html">Proxy Configuration</a> for details.
<p>
<p><b>Q: What protocol does Java Plug-in Software support over the proxy?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, Gopher, and SOCKS are supported. </p>
<p><b>Q: Does Java Plug-in Software support SSL?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>Yes, SSL is supported through Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE). 
<p><b>Q: Is there a way to pre-load Java Plug-in Software during the browser startup?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator do not have mechanisms to 
  support pre-loading Java Plug-in Software during startup. You can work around 
  this limitation by providing your own startup page that launches a dummy applet 
  using Java Plug-in Software. 
<p><b>Q: Can I set up Java Plug-in Software to download from an intranet web server 
  (behind a firewall) rather than from Sun's web site?&nbsp;</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>Yes. For more information, see <a href="../intranet.html">Intranet 
  With <code>OBJECT</code>/<code>EMBED</code> Tag</a> under Part II: Deployment 
  Schemes.
<p><b>Q: How can I open the Java Plug-in Control Panel on Microsoft Windows?&nbsp;</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>On the Start menu, choose Start>Settings>Control Panel, then double-click 
  on the steaming Java cup icon labeled <i>Java Plug-in</i>. 
<h2><b><font size=+1><a name="version"></a></font></b>Version Information </h2>
<p><b>Q: How can I tell what version of Java Plug-in Software has been installed?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>There are a couple of ways: 
<ul>
  <li>Check the version number in <tt>C:\Windows\Downloaded Program Files\Java 
    Runtime Environment</tt> or <code>C:\WINNT\Downloaded Program Files\</code>
  <li>Open Netscape Navigator. Go to the Help>About Plugins. Check the MIME types 
    listed under Java Plug-in. If the following exist: 
    <blockquote> 
      <p><code>application/x-java-applet;version=1.4</code>, you are using Java 
        Plug-in Software 1.4 </p>
      <p><code>application/x-java-applet;version=1.3</code>, you are using Java 
        Plug-in Software 1.3 </p>
      <p><code>application/x-java-applet;version=1.2</code>, you are using Java 
        Plug-in Software 1.2 </p>
      <p><code>application/x-java-applet;version=1.1.2</code>, you are using Java 
        Plug-in Software 1.1.2 </p>
      <p><code>application/x-java-applet;version=1.1.1</code>, you are using Java 
        Plug-in Software 1.1.1 </p>
      <p><code>application/x-java-applet;version=1.1</code>, you are using Java 
        Plug-in Software 1.1</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Note: You may see more than one if you have multiple versions of Java Plug-in 
      installed.</p>
</ul>
<p><b>Q: Can different versions of Java Plug-in Software co-exist on the same
