      <b>"@deprecated": Mechanical Help for Abandoning Old APIs</b>
</center>

<p>
John R. Rose<br>
Oct 4, 1996
<p>
<b>Problem:</b> 
<p>
Java 1.1 introduces many new APIs, some of which supersede
older ones.  The new and old APIs co-exist in the same packages.
The superseded ones add various difficulties to the programmer's job,
the chief being the need to ignore and avoid them in most cases.
<p>
Partial Solution: If we mark superseded classes, methods, and fields
clearly and unambiguously as "deprecated", the programmers will know
where to concentrate their attention.  Also, the compiler will be able
to help with this process, by bringing unintentional uses of deprecated
APIs to the programmer's attention.
<p>
<b>Details:</b>
<p>
Within documentation comments, we define the new paragraph tag
"@deprecated".  (See JLS, $$184.)  It can appear in both class and
member documentation comments, and will apply specifically the construct
its comment introduces.
<p>
The tagged paragraph can be empty.  If it is not, it should tell the
programmer how to avoid using the deprecated feature.
<p>
There should be "@see" tagged paragraphs which refer to the new versions
of the same functionality.
<p>
As far as the compiler is concerned, the presence of the string
"@deprecated" at the beginning of a documentation comment line (except
for whitespace) causes it to place a "Deprecated" attribute in the
output classfile for the corresponding class, field, or method.
<p>
Moreover, in parallel with the access checking logic for classes and
members, the compiler looks for "Deprecated" attributes of classes and
members being accessed, and issues warnings when the deprecated classes
or members are used.
<p>
Note that deprecation applies to classes and to individual members, not
to their names.  It is possible for a single method to have deprecated
and non-deprecated overloadings.  It is possible for a non-deprecated
member to hide or override a deprecated one, which removes deprecation.
It is the responsibility of the programmer to deprecate overrides of
a deprecated method, if in fact they should be deprecated.
<p>
A deprecation warning is suppressed if the compilation unit containing
the deprecation is being compiled at the same time as the compilation
unit using the deprecated class or member.  This allows legacy APIs to
be built without warnings.  There currently is no other way to suppress
the deprecation warnings.
<p>
A hypothetical "-strict" option to the compiler could promote all
warnings, including deprecation warnings, to hard errors.  This is not
in 1.1.
<p>
Javadoc should somehow highlight deprecation paragraphs, and perhaps
should place a characteristic glyph next to references to deprecated
names.
<p>
<b>Practice:</b>
<p>
Here is an example of the most common form of a deprecated method:
<p><pre>
    /**
     * @deprecated
     * @see #getPreferredSize
     */
    public Dimension preferredSize() {
	return getPreferredSize();
    }
</pre>
(Notes:  The "@deprecated" tag must be followed by a space or newline.
The "@see" tag must be at the beginning of the line.  See the JLS,
chapter 18.)
<p>
If the deprecation is a simple renaming, there is no need to say
something like "this method is replaced by getPreferredSize";
the "@see"-tagged paragraph points the user to the replacement.
<p>
The deprecation may be more complex if the API was reorganized by other
than a renaming of features.  Here is an example of a method that is
being retracted:
<p><pre>
    /**
     * Delete multiple items from the list.
     *
     * @deprecated  Not for public use in the future.
     * This method is expected to be retained only as a package
     * private method.
     * @see #remove(int)
     * @see #removeAll()
     */
    public synchronized void delItems(int start, int end) {
    ...
    }
</pre>
Designers of new 1.1 APIs should carefully consider whether they are
superseding old APIs.  For each such API, if they wish to encourage
users of the old previous API to migrate to the new API, they should
add a deprecation paragraph to the documentation comment.  Empty
deprecation paragraphs are bad form, because they do not help the
user fix the warnings that arise from the deprecation.
<p>
Valid reasons for wishing one's users to migrate to the new API include:
<ul>
 <li> the old API is insecure, buggy, or highly inefficient
 <li> the old API is going away in a future release
 <li> the old API encourages very bad coding practices
</ul>
<p>
Not all of these reasons are of equal weight, yet deprecation is a
reasonable (though not mandatory) choice in all these cases.  Therefore,
the use of deprecated APIs can never be made a hard error by default.
Also, the deprecation comments need to help the user decide when to
move to the new API, and so should briefly mention the technical reasons
for deprecation.
<p>
(It is probably <b>not</b> good to specifically mention a timetable for
phase-out of the deprecated API; this is a business decision that needs
to be communicated other ways.)
<p>
It is not necessary to deprecate individual members of a deprecated
class, unless of course the programmer wants to explain some specific
point about one member.
<p>
When a feature is deprecated, it is a good idea to notify the
engineering organization of this fact, so that other engineers can
respond to the change (pro or con) in a timely manner.
<p>
<b>Other Design Options:</b>
<p>
This is the first time the compiler is in any way cognizant of document
comment contents.  (Once, it made sure that they were at the right place
in the parse tree, but this is no longer true.)  We did not lightly
choose to make the compiler's behavior dependent on the contents of a
comment.
<p>
One precedent for looking into comments is "lint", which uses comments
like /*PRINTFLIKE2*/ to annotate C APIs.
<p>
Note that Java documentation comments are structured, and the structure
is specified in the Java Language Specification.  This means that we
"own" the format of this particular sort of comment, so our design is
somewhat more reasonable than the less-differentiated conventions used
by lint.
<p>
We considered introducing pragmas, and using them for deprecation (e.g.,
<*deprecated*>) but this would open the door very wide to many sorts of
incompatible extensions and, possibly, to serious abuses.
<p>
However, @deprecated does work like a pragma:  It belongs in the source,
expresses information about it, but does not modify its semantics.
Unlike many pragmas, @deprecated is intended for a human audience.
<p>
The compiler emits warnings as a friendly and helpful reminder, but does
not enforce any rules.  It's up to the programmer to use the contents of
the deprecation paragraph.  Since the human is the primary user of the
data, it belongs in comments.
<p>
We considered introducing a new keyword, something like "transient".
This would solve the mechanical problem, but at the cost of modifying
the language itself.  In particular, we would have to take away an
identifier from coders that we had not previously reserved (like "var").
Moreover, since the primary audience of deprecations is humans, a
keyword-based approach is insufficient, and must be augmented by comment
conventions, preferably ones which integrate with javadoc.  Thus, the
keyword approach does not pay.
<p>
Still, the compiler has heretofore ignored and should generally ignore
documentation comments.  This is an admittedly irregular exception to
that practice.  But the other design options for deprecation involve
worse sorts of irregularity.
