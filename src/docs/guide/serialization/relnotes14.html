<blockquote>
The following are enhancements to serialization in version 
1.4 of the Java 2 Platform.  For a summary of enhancements 
in previous releases, see <a href=relnotes.html><b>Enhancements 
in Previous Releases</b></a>.
<dl>
<dt><b>Support for deserialization of unshared objects</b></dt>
<dd>Serialization now provides extra support for deserialization of 
objects which are known to be unshared in the data-serialization 
stream.  The new support is provided by the following API additions 
in package <tt>java.io</tt>:
<blockquote>
<font size="-1">
<a href="../../api/java/io/ObjectInputStream.html#readUnshared()">
<tt>ObjectInputStream.readUnshared()</tt></a><p>
<a href="../../api/java/io/ObjectOutputStream.html#writeUnshared(java.lang.Object)"><tt>ObjectOutputStream.writeUnshared(Object obj)</tt></a><p>
<a href="../../api/java/io/ObjectStreamField.html#ObjectStreamField(java.lang.String, java.lang.Class, boolean)"><tt>ObjectStreamField(String name, 
Class type, boolean unshared)</tt></a>
</font>
</blockquote>
    Previously, security-conscious programmers had to clone private internal
    objects after deserializing them to guard against the possibility that
    outside parties with access to the serialization stream could append
    spurious back handles to the sensitive objects, resulting in extra
    references to them during deserialization.  However, this solution slows
    performance and wastes memory -- two objects must be created and a copy
    operation invoked in order to ensure a unique reference to a single usable
    object.  The new API additions provide a more efficient solution by
    allowing receivers to invalidate "unshared" objects as they are read in,
    making it impossible for third parties to dereference back-handles to those
    objects occurring later in the stream.
</dd>
<p>

<dt><b>Security permissions now required to override putFields, readFields</b></dt>
<dd>
Beginning with J2SE 1.4.0, ObjectOutputStream's 
<a href="../../api/java/io/ObjectOutputStream.html#ObjectOutputStream(java.io.OutputStream)">public one-argument constructor</a> requires the
"enableSubclassImplementation" SerializablePermission when invoked
(either directly or indirectly) by a subclass which overrides
<a href="../../api/java/io/ObjectOutputStream.html#putFields()"><tt>ObjectOutputStream.putFields</tt></a> or <a href="../../api/java/io/ObjectOutputStream.html#writeUnshared(java.lang.Object)"><tt>ObjectOutputStream.writeUnshared</tt></a>.
<p>
Also beginning with J2SE 1.4.0, ObjectInputStream's 
<a href="../../api/java/io/ObjectInputStream.html#ObjectInputStream(java.io.InputStream)">public one-argument constructor</a> requires the
"enableSubclassImplementation" SerializablePermission when invoked
(either directly or indirectly) by a subclass which overrides
<a href="../../api/java/io/ObjectInputStream.html#readFields()"><tt>ObjectInputStream.readFields</tt></a> or <a href="../../api/java/io/ObjectInputStream.html#readUnshared()"><tt>ObjectInputStream.readUnshared</tt></a>.
<p>
These changes will not affect the great majority of applications. 
However, it will affect any ObjectInputStream/ObjectOutputStream
subclasses which override the <tt>putFields</tt> or <tt>readFields</tt> 
methods without also overriding the rest of the serialization infrastructure.
</dd>
<p>

<dt><b>Support for class-defined readObjectNoData method</b></dt>
<dd>
In addition to supporting class-defined <tt>writeObject()</tt> 
and <tt>readObject()</tt>
methods, serialization now includes support for class-defined
<tt>readObjectNoData()</tt> methods.  Each class-defined 
<tt>readObjectNoData()</tt> method is required to have 
the following signature:
<font size="-1">
<blockquote><pre>
private void readObjectNoData() throws ObjectStreamException;
</pre></blockquote>
</font>
The <tt>readObjectNoData()</tt> method is analogous to the class-defined 
<tt>readObject()</tt> method, except that (if defined) it is called in 
cases where the class descriptor for a superclass of the object being 
deserialized (and hence the object data described by that class descriptor) 
is not present in the serialization stream. More formally: 
<blockquote>
      If object O of class C is being deserialized, and S is a superclass of C
      in the VM which is deserializing O, then <tt>S.readObjectNoData()</tt> 
      is invoked by ObjectInputStream during the deserialization of O if 
      and only if the following conditions are true:
<ol>
        <li>  S implements java.io.Serializable (directly or indirectly).

        <li>  S defines an <tt>readObjectNoData()</tt> method with 
          the signature listed above.

        <li>  The serialization stream containing O does not include a class
            descriptor for S among its list of superclass descriptors for C.
</ol>
</blockquote>
Note that <tt>readObjectNoData()</tt> is never invoked in cases 
where a class-defined <tt>readObject()</tt> method could be called, 
though serializable class implementors can call 
<tt>readObjectNoData()</tt> from within <tt>readObject()</tt> as a 
means of consolidating initialization code.
<p>
See the class description in the API specification of <a href="../../api/java/io/ObjectInputStream.html">ObjectInputStream</a> for more information.
</dd>
<p>
<dt><b>Bug fix: Deserialization fails for Class object of primitive type</b></dt>
<dd>
In previous releases, bug <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4171142.html">4171142</a> caused attempts 
to deserialize Class objects of primitive types to fail with a 
<tt>ClassNotFoundException</tt>.  The problem was that 
<tt>ObjectInputStream.resolveClass()</tt> did not work for 
ObjectStreamClass descriptors for primitive types.  This bug 
is fixed in J2SE 1.4.0.
</dd>
<p>
<dt><b>Bug fix: ObjectInputStream.resolveProxyClass can fail for non-public
  interface cases</b></dt>
<dd>
In previous releases, <a href="../../api/java/io/ObjectInputStream.html#resolveProxyClass(java.lang.String[])"><tt>ObjectInputStream.resolveProxyClass</tt></a> would not always
select the proper class loader to define the proxy class in if one or more
of the proxy interfaces were non-public.  In this release,
if <tt>ObjectInputStream.resolveProxyClass</tt> detects a non-public interface, it
attempts to define the implementing proxy class in the same class loader as
the interface (barring conflicts, in which case an exception is thrown),
which is necessary in order for the proxy to implement the interface.
</dd>
<p>
<dt><b>Bug fix: Invalid serialPersistentFields field name causes
  NullPointerException</b></dt>
<dd>In previous releases, bug <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4387368.html">4387368</a> caused NullPointerExceptions to be thrown
when serializing objects which used default serialization but also declared
serialPersistentField entries which did not map to actual class fields.
Serialization will now throw InvalidClassExceptions in such cases (since it
is never necessary to define such "unbacked" serialPersistentFields when
using default serialization).
</dd>
<p>
<dt><b>Bug fix: ClassNotFoundException in skipped objects causes 
serialization to fail</b></dt>
<dd>In previous releases, ClassNotFoundExceptions triggered by "skipped"
objects--objects associated with fields not present in the classes loaded
by the deserializing party--would cause deserialization of the entire
object graph to fail, even though the skipped values would not be included
in the graph.  This release of serialization addresses this problem by
ignoring ClassNotFoundExceptions associated with such skipped objects, thus
eliminating a class of unnecessary deserialization errors.  Other
miscellaneous changes have also been made to improve the overall robustness
of serialization with regards to ClassNotFoundExceptions encountered during
deserialization.
