<blockquote>
The following are some of the changes and have helped to reduce 
startup time and decrease the amount of memory used by the 
Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> 2 SDK and Java 2 Runtime Environment.

<ul>
<li><b>Swing Class Loading</b> - In version 1.3, loading of some Swing classes 
is delayed until they are actually needed by the runtime environment. In 
version 1.2, Swing classes were loaded at startup regardless of whether the 
classes were needed immediately. This change reduces startup time.
<p>
<li><b>JAR File Memory Usage Rection</b> - The way JAR files are indexed in memory 
has been improved so that the memory cost of loading a 
JAR file has been greatly reduced.  The class libraries in <tt>rt.jar</tt>, 
for example, occupied about 420 KB of memory when loaded in version 1.2, but 
require only about 100 KB in version 1.3.
<p>
<li><b>JTable</b> - In version 1.3, loading of international date and number 
formatting code by JTable is deferred until the internationalization code is 
needed by the runtime environment. In version 1.2, class JTable loaded 
the intenationalization code at startup, even if it was not needed immediately. 
This change reduces startup time.
<p>
<li><b>Size of DLLs Reduced</b> - In version 1.3, the size of DLL libraries 
have been reduced in terms of memory footprint (by about 280 KB) and 
download size (by about 250 KB), with no detrimental effect on execution speed.
<p>
<li><b>Remove Dependencies on Seldom-Used DLLs</b> - In version 1.3, DLLs 
that handle dialog boxes and drag-and-drop functionality are loaded only 
if they are actually needed.  In version 1.2, some of these libraries 
were loaded at startup regardless of whether they would ever be used. 
This change reduces startup time.
<p>
<li><b>Reduce Memory Footprint Associated with Strings</b> - In version 1.3 
of the SDK, <tt>java.lang.String</tt> has been modified to load 
the relatively small <tt>java.io.ObjectStreamField</tt> class for 
handling serialization requirements.  In 1.2, <tt>String</tt> loaded 
the much larger <tt>java.io.ObjectStreamClass</tt> for this purpose.
<p>
<li><b>The size of internal VM datastructures used by the client 
virtual machine have been reduced.
</ul>
