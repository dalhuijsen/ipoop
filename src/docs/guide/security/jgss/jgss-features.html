New Features in Java<SUP><FONT size=-2>TM</FONT></SUP> GSS
for Java <SUP><FONT size=-2>TM</FONT></SUP> 2 SDK, Standard Edition, v 1.4.2 include the 
  following:</FONT></B> 
  <UL>
    <LI><B>Configurable Kerberos Settings</B> <BR>The Kerberos Key Distribution 
    Center (KDC) name and realm settings are provided in the Kerberos 
    configuration file or via the system properties 
    <CODE>java.security.krb5.kdc</CODE> and 
    <CODE>java.security.krb5.realm</CODE>. In previous releases, changes to the 
    Kerberos configuration values would only take effect when an application was 
    restarted. 
    <P>In the 1.4.2 release of the Java platform, a new boolean option 
    <CODE>refreshKrb5Config</CODE> can be specified in the entry for 
    <CODE>Krb5LoginModule</CODE> in the JAAS configuration file. If this option 
    is set to <CODE>true</CODE>, the configuration values will be refreshed 
    before the <CODE>login</CODE> method of the <CODE>Krb5LoginModule</CODE> is 
    called. 
    <P></P>
    <LI><B>Support for Slave Kerberos Key Distribution Center</B> <BR>Kerberos 
    allows the use of slave KDCs so that if the master KDC is unavailable, the 
    slave KDCs will respond to user requests. In earlier releases of the J2SE, 
    Sun's implementation of Kerberos tried only the master KDC and would give up 
    if there was no response within the default KDC timeout specified in the 
    Kerberos configuration file, or 30 seconds if no timeout had been specified. 

    <P>With this 1.4.2 release, Sun's implementation of Kerberos will retry with 
    the slave KDC(s), if they are specified. The slave KDCs can be specified in 
    the Kerberos configuration file or via a list of KDCs separated by a colon 
    (<CODE>:</CODE>) in the system property <CODE>java.security.krb5.kdc</CODE>. 

    <P></P>
    <LI><B>Support TCP for Kerberos Key Distribution Center Transport</B> 
    <BR>
    Sun's implementation of Kerberos implements Kerberos version 5 according to 
    <A href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1510.txt">RFC 1510</A> and uses 
    UDP transport for ticket requests. A new Internet draft updates this 
    RFC. One of the added features is required support for TCP as a 
    transport in addition to UDP. As a result, in cases where Kerberos 
    tickets exceed the UDP packet size limit, the KDC would return an 
    error code indicating that the request should be resent over TCP. 
    <P>
    In the current 1.4.2 release, Sun's implementation of Kerberos 
    now supports automatic fallback to TCP. Therefore, if the Kerberos 
    ticket request using UDP fails and the KDC returns the error code 
    <code>KRB_ERR_RESPONSE_TOO_BIG</code>, TCP is automatically the 
    default transport.
    <P>
    The current draft which updates RFC 1510, is available online: 
<A href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-krb-wg-kerberos-clarifications-04.txt">http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-krb-wg-kerberos-clarifications-04.txt</A>. 
    </P></LI>

<B>Kerberos Service Ticket in the Subject's Private Credentials</b>
<BR>

The Kerberos service ticket is now stored in the Subject's 
private credentials. 
This change allows application developers access 
to the service ticket so that it can be used outside 
the JGSS (for example, in native applications or 
for proprietary uses). In addition, the service ticket 
can now be reused if the application tries to establish 
a security context to the same service again. The 
service ticket should be valid for it to be reusable.
<P>
Previously, when using Java Generic Security 
Services (JGSS) over Kerberos V5, if the <code> 
<a href="/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/org/ietf/jgss/package-summary.html">useSubjectCredsOnly</A></code> 
property was set to true, the Ticket Granting Ticket 
(TGT) was retrieved from the Subject and used to 
establish a GSS Security context. The service ticket 
obtained was not stored in the Subject. 

Now the service ticket is also stored in the 
Subject if <code>useSubjectCredsOnly</code> is true. 

<P>If a client 
application searches through the Subject's private 
credentials, in previous releases it would find only the 
TGT. As of this release, it also will find any Service 
ticket(s) obtained. 
<P>
The bug report associated with this change is 4688866.
