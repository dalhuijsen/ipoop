The following are known bugs and other networking issues for Java<SUP><FONT 
size=-2>TM</FONT></SUP> 2 SDK, Standard Edition, v1.4.2. 
<UL>
  <LI>In releases prior to 1.4.2, it was possible to create an invalid URL instance 
    such as the following: <code>new URL (&quot;http://www.foo.com:-1/index.html&quot;)</code>. 
    Specifying a port number of <code>-1</code> is not valid. However, in previous 
    releases the <code>-1</code> was stripped off when sending such URLS with 
    HTTP commands. In 1.4.2, the <code>-1</code> is left in the URL and this may 
    cause problems for some HTTP servers or proxies. Applications should not create 
    URL instances with a <code>-1</code> port number. Assuming the <code>-1</code> 
    refers to the default port in this example, the correct way to create this 
    URL is <code>new URL (&quot;http://www.foo.com/index.html&quot;)</code>. This 
    note only applies to the single argument URL constructor. 
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>On Microsoft Windows 98/ME, a read timeout set using <TT>Socket.setSoTimeout</TT> 
    or an accept timeout set using <TT>ServerSocket.setSoTimeout</TT> may result 
    in a timeout that is 500ms later than expected. This issue is observable with 
    all J2SE releases and stems from a Microsoft Windows 98/ME bug. A patch for 
    Microsoft Windows 98/ME is obtainable through the following page on the Microsoft 
    website: <A 
  href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;Q257821&amp;">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;Q257821&amp;</A>
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>Prior to J2SE 1.4.1 the <TT>java.net.InetAddress.getLocalHost()</TT> would 
    cache the lookup of the IP address of the local machine for the entire session 
    of the application. This behaviour poses a problem for applications running 
    on machines that are connected to the internet via a dial-up connection or 
    machines that acquired their addresses through DHCP. This has been corrected 
    in 1.4.1 so that the local IP address is no longer cached. <TT>InetAddress.getLocalHost()</TT> 
    will return the correct IP address for dial-up connections as well as for 
    DHCP. See bug <A 
  href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4211819.html">4211819</A>. 
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>Prior to J2SE 1.4.1, the http/https protocol handlers would not redirect 
    correctly from a http URL to a https URL (and vice versa). In particular, 
    the redirect was attempted using the original URL scheme. This has been fixed 
    in 1.4.1. by returning the server responses for such redirects (from http 
    to https or https to http) to the application. Therefore, it is the applications 
    responsibility to check the response code and recognize it as a redirect. 
    The Location header field value can be checked for the redirect information, 
    and then the application must decide whether or not to follow the redirect 
    using the new protocol. See bug <A 
  href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4620571.html">4620571</A>. 
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>Prior to J2SE 1.4 the <TT>java.net.URLConnection</TT> class would handle 
    errors from http servers inconsistently. In particular the <TT>getInputStream</TT> 
    or other methods would throw a FileNotFoundException if the http server returned 
    a response code &gt;= 400 and the request was for a resource of a known file 
    type. 
    <P>This has been corrected in 1.4 so that an IOException is thrown for any 
      http error from the server and a specific exception of FileNotFoundExeption 
      when the resource is not found (ie: 404 or 410 response codes). The exception 
      is thrown irrespective of the file type. 
    <P>Applications that assumed an exception would not be thrown when an http 
      error is returned from the server need to be aware of this change in 1.4 
      - see <A 
  href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4160499.html">4160499</A>. 
    <P>Related to this issue is that <TT>HttpURLConnection.getErrorStream()</TT> 
      method can now been used to read the error page from the http server when 
      a http error is returned from the server. Previously <TT>getErrorStream()</TT> 
      always returned <TT>null</TT>. 
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>Prior to J2SE 1.4 the <TT>InetAddress.toString()</TT> would perform a lookup 
    via the name service if the hostname wasn't previously resolved. This is no 
    longer the case in 1.4 and <TT>toString</TT> will return immediately. If the 
    hostname is not resolved the returned string will contain the dotted IP address 
    only. 
    <P>Applications that depend on <TT>toString()</TT> returning a string with 
      the resolved hostname should be aware of this correction in 1.4 - see <A 
  href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4239141.html">4239141</A>. 
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>Prior to J2SE 1.4 if <TT>InetAddress.getByName</TT> if a lookup to the name 
    service failed then all subsequent lookups of that hostname would fail for 
    the lifetime of the virtual machine. This arose because negative lookups were 
    always cached. This has changed in 1.4 so that by default if a lookup fails 
    it's possible for a subsequent lookup to succeed. This is particularly important 
    in dial-up environments or environments where the name service is not reliable. 
    <P>Applications that depend on behaviour where subsequent lookups always failed 
      need to be aware of this issue - see <A 
  href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4256129.html">4256129</A>. 
      In addition the caching of negative lookups can be controlled by the <TT>networkaddress.cache.negative.ttl</TT> 
      property in the <TT>java.security</TT> file. 
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition, v1.4 introduces a new exception <A 
  href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/net/PortUnreachableException.html"><TT>java.net.PortUnreachableException</TT></A>. 
    This exception <EM>may</EM> be thrown by <TT>DatagramSocket.send</TT> or <TT>DatagramSocket.receive</TT> 
    if the DatagramSocket is connected (via the connect method) and an ICMP port 
    unreachable is received to indicate that the remote application is not running. 
    The PortUnreachableException serves as a useful indication for some UDP based 
    protocols. 
    <P>The following lists the known issues with PortUnreachableException :- 
    <OL>
      <LI>On Solaris 8 if IPv6 is enabled then ICMP port unreachable packets from 
        IPv4 hosts will appear to be discarded. This is a Solaris 8 bug and is 
        tracked as bug 4422658. 
      <LI>On some Microsoft Windows releases (specifically Windows 98 and Windows 
        NT) ICMP port unreachable packets are incorrectly discarded by the operating 
        system and thus the PortUnreachableException is not thrown. As this time 
        we are not aware of any Windows Sockets updates from Microsoft to fix 
        this issue. 
      <LI>On Linux if UDP packets are sent to the loopback address and no UDP 
        applicatiob to bound to the destination port no ICMP port unreachable 
        indication is received and thus no PortUnreachableException is thrown. 
        This is a Linux kernel issue and we are not aware of a patch at this time. 
      </LI>
    </OL>
</UL>
<UL>
  <LI>On many Linux installations <TT>InetAddress.getLocalHost()</TT> may return 
    an InetAddress representing the loopback address (127.0.0.1). This stems from 
    many Linux installations configuring /etc/hosts to map the hostname to the 
    loopback address. If the host has a static IP address then the <TT>/etc/hosts</TT> 
    file should be corrected to map the hostname to the host address. 
    <P>If DHCP is used in conjunction with dynamic DNS then there are two options 
      (i) change the name service search order in <TT>/etc/nsswitch.conf</TT> 
      to use dns before the hosts file (ie: "hosts: dns files"), or (ii) configure 
      InetAddress to use the DNS name service provider instead of the default 
      provider (<TT>-Dsun.net.spi.nameservice.provider.1=dns,sun</TT>). This issue 
      is being tracked in <A 
  href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4665037.html">4665037</A>.
