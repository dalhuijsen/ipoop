<H1>When to use Java GSS-API vs. JSSE</H1>

<p>Java GSS-API and JSSE provide you with the same basic set of security features:

<ol>

<li>Client-server authentication<p>

<li>Encryption and integrity protection of transmitted data

</ol>

<p>However, there are some key difference between the two. 
This document lists some 
of them to help you decide which might be more appropriate in your 
environment:

<ol>

<li> <b>Kerberos Single Sign-On Support</b>

<p>In the Java 2 Standard Edition, GSS-API contains support for Kerberos as a
mandatory security mechanism. This means that if your desktop has Kerberos
support, you can write Java GSS-API based applications that never prompt
the user for a password. 

<p>At present JSSE does not support cipher suites to use Kerberos-based
authentication. 
Support for such a cipher suite is dependent on its standarization in the 
TLS protocol at the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).<p>


<li><b>Communications API</b>

<p>JSSE supports a socket-based API. JSSE sockets extend the socket classes 
found in <code>java.net</code> and JSSE socket factories extend the socket 
factories found in <code>javax.net</code>. Thus, if your application is written 
such that its security needs to be configured via a socket factory, then JSSE 
might be more appropriate for you. JSSE sockets need to use some reliable 
transport. Typically, implementations use TCP. 

<p>Java GSS-API, on the other hand, is a token-based API that relies on the 
application to do the communication. This means that the application can 
use TCP sockets, UDP datagrams, or any other channel that will allow it to 
transport Java GSS-API generated tokens. If your application has varying 
communication protocol needs, then Java GSS-API might be more appropriate 
for you. Java GSS-API can read and write its tokens using input and output 
streams. However, you will need to set up the streams yourself.<p>


<li><b>Credential Delegation</b>

<p>Java GSS-API allows the client to delegate its credentials to the server 
when using Kerberos. If your application will be deployed in a multi-tier 
environment where intermediaries need to impersonate clients when talking 
to backend layers, Java GSS-API might be more appropriate for you.<p>


<li><b>Selective Encryption</b>

<p>Because Java GSS-API is token-based, you can choose to selectively 
encrypt certain messages but not all. If your application needs to intersperse 
plaintext and ciphertext messages, Java GSS-API might be more appropriate 
for you.<p>


<li><b>Protocol Requirements</b>

<p>JSSE provides an implementation of the TLS protocol
defined in RFC 2246.  Java GSS-API provides an implementation of the
GSS-API framework defined in RFC 2853,
as well as an implementation of the Kerberos Version 5 mechanism
defined in RFC 1964. (On Microsoft Windows platforms, this may 
be known as SSPI with Kerberos.) 
Some servers such as HTTPS servers will require 
you to use TLS, in which case JSSE will be appropriate for you. 
Other servers such as LDAP servers using SASL might need GSS-API with 
Kerberos, in which case Java GSS-API will be appropriate for you.
