  Dominic Mazzoni

  This abstract class simplifies the implementation of a basic
  monaural effect.  Inherit from it if your effect doesn't just
  modifies a track in place and doesn't care how many samples
  it gets at a time.  Your derived class only needs to implement
  GetEffectName, GetEffectAction, and ProcessSimpleMono.
