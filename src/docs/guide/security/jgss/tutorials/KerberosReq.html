<p>Kerberos Version 5 is used for both the authentication and secure 
communication aspects of the client and server applications developed in 
this tutorial. The reader is assumed to already be familiar with Kerberos.
See the <a href = "http://web.MIT.edu/kerberos/www/index.html">
Kerberos reference documentation</a>.

<p>The JAAS framework, and the Kerberos mechanism required by the 
Java GSS-API methods, are built into the version 1.4 JREs from all vendors. 
(Actually, JAAS was available as a separately-downloadable
optional package starting in version 1.3.) The
Kerberos LoginModule required for the JAAS authentication in this tutorial 
may not be available in all vendors' JREs. We will be using the LoginModule
for Kerberos provided in the JRE from Sun Microsystems (J2RE v 1.4).

<p>In order to run the sample programs, you will need access to a Kerberos 
installation. As described in the following sections, you may also need
a <code>krb5.conf</code> Kerberos configuration file and
an indication as to where that file is located.

<p>As with all Kerberos installations, a Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC)
is required. It needs to contain
the user name and password you will use to be authenticated to Kerberos. 
Note: A KDC implementation is part of a Kerberos installation, not a part of
the J2RE, v 1.4.

<p> As with most Kerberos installations, a Kerberos configuration file 
<code>krb5.conf</code> is consulted to determine such things as the 
default realm and KDC. If you are using a Kerberos implementation 
such as that from Microsoft for Windows 2000, which does not include 
a <code>krb5.conf</code> file, you will either need to create one or
use system properties as described in 
<a href = "#SetProps">Setting Properties to Indicate the Default Realm 
and KDC</a>.


<H2><a name="SetProps">Setting Properties to Indicate the Default Realm 
and KDC</a></H2>

<blockquote>

<p>Typically, the default realm and the KDC for that realm
are indicated in the Kerberos <code>krb5.conf</code> 
configuration file. However, if you like, you can instead specify these
values by setting the following system properties to indicate the
realm and KDC, respectively:

<blockquote>
<pre>
java.security.krb5.realm 
java.security.krb5.kdc
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>If you set one of these properties you must 
set them both. 

<p>Also note that if you set these properties, then no
cross-realm authentication is possible unless a
<code>krb5.conf</code> file is also provided from which
the additional information required for cross-realm authentication 
may be obtained.

<p>If you set values for these properties, then they override the
default realm and KDC values specified in <code>krb5.conf</code> (if such a file
is found). The <code>krb5.conf</code> file is still consulted if
values for items other than the default realm and KDC are needed.
If no <code>krb5.conf</code> file is found, then the default values
used for these items are implementation-specific.

</blockquote>


<H2>Locating the <code>krb5.conf</code> Configuration File</H2>

<blockquote>

<p>The essential Kerberos configuration information is the default
realm and the default KDC. As shown in
<a href = "#SetProps">Setting Properties to Indicate the Default Realm 
and KDC</a>, if you set properties to indicate these values,
they are not obtained from a <code>krb5.conf</code> configuration file.

<p>If these properties do not have values set, or if other Kerberos
configuration information is needed, an attempt is made to find the
required information in a <code>krb5.conf</code> file.
The algorithm to locate the 
<code>krb5.conf</code> file is the following:

<ul>

<li>If the system property <code>java.security.krb5.conf</code> is set, its 
value is assumed to specify the path and file name.<p>

<li>If that system property value is not set, then the configuration file
is looked for in the directory

<blockquote>
<pre>
&lt;java-home&gt;\lib\security      [Windows]
&lt;java-home&gt;/lib/security      [Solaris and Linux]
</pre>
</blockquote>

Here <tt>&lt;java-home&gt;</tt> refers to the directory where the JRE
was installed. For example, if you have J2SDK v 1.4 installed on Solaris
in a directory named <code>/jdk1.4</code>, the directory in which the
configuration file is looked for is:

<blockquote><pre>
/jdk1.4/jre/lib/security 
</pre></blockquote>

<li>If the file is still not found, then an attempt is made to locate
it as follows:

<blockquote>
<pre>
/etc/krb5/krb5.conf                [Solaris]
c:\winnt\krb5.ini                  [Windows]
/etc/krb5.conf                     [Linux]
</pre>
</blockquote>

<li>If the file is still not found, and the configuration information
being searched for is <i>not</i> the default realm and KDC, then
implementation-specific defaults are used. If, on the other hand,
the configuration information being searched for is the
default realm and KDC because they weren't specified in system properties,
and the <code>krb5.conf</code> file is not found either, then
an exception is thrown. 

</ol>
