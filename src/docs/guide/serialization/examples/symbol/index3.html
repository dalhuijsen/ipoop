      <P>This example demonstrates how to use the <TT>writeReplace/readResolve</TT>
        methods. The <TT>readResolve</TT> method resolves the object read from
        the stream before it is returned to the caller. The <TT>writeReplace</TT>
        method allows a <TT>Serializable</TT> class of an object to nominate
        its own replacement in the stream before the object is written.</P>
      
      <P>This example creates a symbol class for which only one instance of
        each each symbol binding exists. The <TT>Symbol</TT> class defines the
        <TT>readResolve</TT> method. A symbol is created from outside using the
        <TT>symbollookup</TT> method. The <TT>symbollookup</TT> method finds
        and returns a symbol if one already and, if one does not already exist,
        creates one. This assures uniqueness within one VM. Then, when the <TT>readResolve</TT>
        method is called as the symbol is being read, a preexisting equivalent
        Symbol object is substituted from the hashtable to maintain the unique
        identity constraint, if such a symbol exists. If the symbol does not
        exist, the new symbol is added to the hashtable and returned. This
        assures uniqueness when dealing with more than one VM.</P> </BLOCKQUOTE>
