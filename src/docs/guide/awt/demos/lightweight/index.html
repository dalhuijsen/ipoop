<h1>
Lightweight Components
</h1>

Starting with the JDK 1.1 Beta 3 release, 
the AWT supports lightweight components.
Lightweight components are essential
in the following situations:

<ul>
<li> You want to create a custom component
     that isn't rectangular.
<li> You want to create a custom component 
     that's partly (or entirely) transparent.
<li> You want to use multiple components 
     that can draw in each others' areas.
<li> Your program contains many components
     and would be too inefficient 
     if implemented with heavyweight components.
</ul>

<p>

This page tells you 
<a href=#overview>how to create lightweight components</a>,
and then gives you links to 
<a href=#code>examples</a> --
pages with applets
that use lightweight components
(source code included, of course).
For more details about what lightweight components are
and how they work, see
<a href="../../1.3/designspec/lightweights.html">Java AWT: Lightweight UI
Framework</a>.


<h2>
<a name=overview>
How to Create Lightweight Components
</a>
</h2>

To create a lightweight component, 
you need to create a class that directly extends
one of the following classes:

<p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="../../../../api/java/awt/Component.html">
<code>Component</code></a>
<li> <a href="../../../../api/java/awt/Container.html">
<code>Container</code></a>
<li> a class that implements a lightweight component --
     for example, a non-AWT class that is a subclass of 
     <code>Component</code> or
     <code>Container</code>
</ul>

Your class needs to provide
both the look and the feel of the component.
You'll typically need to implement
the following methods:

<ul>
<li> One or more constructors.
     If the component responds to any events, 
     such as mouse clicks,
     the constructor(s) should invoke
     the <code>enableEvents</code> method.
<li> The <code>paint</code> method,
     so that it draws the component's representation onscreen.
<li> As appropriate, methods to let 
     the state of the component be changed programmatically --
     for example, <code>setText</code>.
     Besides changing the component's internal state,
     each of these methods should call the 
     <code>repaint</code> method
     if the component's appearance should change.
     If the component's size should change,
     then call the <code>invalidate</code> method
     before calling <code>repaint</code>.
<li> As appropriate, methods to let
     listeners be registered and unregistered for the component.
     For example, a button
     should implement the <code>addActionListener</code> 
     and <code>removeActionListener</code> methods,
     which should add the specified listener using the
     <code>AWTEventMulticaster add</code> and
     <code>remove</code> methods, respectively.
<li> The <code>contains</code> method
     if the component responds to events
     to only part of its entire possible drawing area.
<li> Any appropriate <code>process<em>Xxx</em></code> methods.
     For example, a button would implement
     <code>processMouseEvent</code>
     to change the button's state
     and to generate <code>actionPerformed</code> messages as appropriate.

</ul>

<p>

Lightweight components place special requirements on
their containers:

<ul>
<li> Lightweight components sometimes flash noticeably
     unless you put them in a container that performs double buffering.
     See the 
     <a href=#gauge>Gauge example</a>
     for an example of a double-buffered container.
<li> Lightweight components will <em>not</em> appear
     if their container implements a <code>paint</code>
     method that doesn't call <code>super.paint</code>.
     In other words,
     if you implement a container that performs some drawing --
     for example, one that draws a box around its display area --
     make sure the container's <code>paint</code> method
     invokes <code>super.paint</code>!
</ul>

Code Examples and Applets
</a>
</h2>

This section links to four pages,
each with an example
that illustrates an aspect of lightweight components.
Each page includes one applet 
and links to the applet's source code.
If you're using a browser that includes support for 1.1beta3,
then your browser will be able to run
the applet on each page.
Otherwise,
you'll need to use another tool,
such as the JDK Applet Viewer,
to view the applet on each page.

     using double buffering to eliminate flicker.
     Contains sourced code for both 1.1-only
     and "Swing" versions of the example.
