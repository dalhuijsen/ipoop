<br>
<br>

<p>This tutorial expands the program and policy file developed in the
<a href="AcnOnly.html">JAAS Authentication</a> tutorial 
to demonstrate the JAAS authorization component,
which ensures the authenticated caller has the access control rights 
(permissions) required to do subsequent security-sensitive operations.
Since the authorization component requires that the user
authentication first be completed, please read the
<a href="AcnOnly.html">JAAS Authentication</a>
tutorial first if you have not already done so.

<p>The rest of this tutorial consists of the following sections:

<a name="WhatIsAzn">
<H2>What is JAAS Authorization? </H2></a>

<blockquote>

<p>JAAS authorization extends the existing Java security
architecture that uses a security <a href = "../../PolicyFiles.html">
policy</a> to specify what access
rights are granted to executing code. That architecture, introduced
in the Java 2 platform, is <i>code-centric</i>. That is, the permissions are
granted based on code characteristics: where the code is coming
from and whether it is digitally signed and if so by whom. We saw
an example of this in the <code>jaasacn.policy</code> file used in the
<a href="AcnOnly.html">JAAS Authentication</a> tutorial.
That file contains the following:

<blockquote>
<pre>
grant codebase "file:./JaasAcn.jar" {
   permission javax.security.auth.AuthPermission 
                    "createLoginContext.JaasSample";
};</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This grants the code in the <code>JaasAcn.jar</code> file, located in the
current directory, the specified permission. (No signer is specified, so
it doesn't matter whether the code is signed or not.)

<p>JAAS authorization augments the existing code-centric access controls
with new <i>user-centric</i> access controls. Permissions can be
granted based not just on what code is running but also on <i>who</i> 
is running it. 

<p>When an application uses JAAS authentication
to authenticate the user (or other entity such as a service), a
<a href="../../../../api/javax/security/auth/Subject.html">
Subject</a> is created as a result. The purpose of the Subject 
is to represent the authenticated user.
A Subject is comprised of a set of
<a href="../../../../api/java/security/Principal.html">
Principals</a>, where each Principal represents an identity for
that user. For example, a Subject could have a name Principal 
("Susan Smith") and a Social Security Number Principal ("987-65-4321"),
thereby distinguishing this Subject from other Subjects.

<p>Permissions can be granted in the policy to specific 
Principals. After the user has been authenticated, the application can 
associate the Subject with the current access control context. 
For each subsequent security-checked operation,
(a local file access, for example), the Java runtime will
automatically determine whether the policy grants the 
required permission only to a specific Principal and if so, 
the operation will be allowed only if the Subject associated with
the access control context contains the designated Principal.

</blockquote>


<a name="InvokingAzn">
<H2>How is JAAS Authorization Performed?</H2></a>

<blockquote>

<p>To make JAAS authorization take place, 
the following is required:

<ul>

<li>The user must be authenticated, as described in the
<a href="AcnOnly.html">JAAS Authentication</a> tutorial. <p>

<li><a href="#UserPFStmts">Principal-based entries</a> must be configured 
in the security policy. <p>

<li>The Subject that is the result of authentication must be
<a href="#AssocSubject">associated with the current access control context</a>. 

</ul>


<a name="UserPFStmts">
<H3>How Do You Make Principal-Based Policy File Statements?</H3></a>

<blockquote>

<p><a href = "../../PolicyFiles.html">
Policy file</a> <code>grant</code> statements can now optionally include
one or more Principal fields. Inclusion of a Principal field
indicates that the user or other entity represented by
the specified Principal, executing the specified code,
has the designated permissions.

<p>Thus, the basic format of a <code>grant</code> statement is now

<blockquote>
<pre>
grant &lt;<i>signer(s) field</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>codeBase URL</i>&gt; 
  &lt;<i>Principal field(s)</i>&gt; {
    permission <i>perm_class_name</i> "<i>target_name</i>", "<i>action</i>";
    ....
    permission <i>perm_class_name</i> "<i>target_name</i>", "<i>action</i>";
  };
</pre>
</blockquote>

where each of the signer, codeBase and Principal fields is
optional and the order between the fields doesn't matter.

<p>A Principal field looks like the following:

<blockquote>
<pre>
Principal <i>Principal_class</i> "<i>principal_name</i>"
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>That is, it is the word "Principal" (where case doesn't matter)
followed by the (fully qualified) name of a Principal class and 
a principal name.

<p>A Principal class is a class that implements the 
<a href="../../../../api/java/security/Principal.html">
java.security.Principal</a> interface. 
All Principal objects have an associated name that can be
obtained by calling their <code>getName</code> method.
The format used for the name is dependent on each
Principal implementation.

<p>The type of Principal placed in the Subject created by the Kerberos 
authentication mechanism used by this tutorial is 
<code>javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosPrincipal</code>,
so that is what should be used as the <code><i>Principal_class</i></code> 
part of our <code>grant</code> statement's Principal designation.
User names for <code>KerberosPrincipal</code>s are of the form 
"name@realm". Thus, if the user name is "mjones" and the realm is
"KRBNT-OPS.ABC.COM", the full <code><i>principal_name</i></code> designation 
to use in the <code>grant</code> statement is "mjones@KRBNT-OPS.ABC.COM".

<p>It is possible to include more than one Principal field in a 
<code>grant</code> statement.
If multiple Principal fields are specified, then the permissions in that
<code>grant</code> statement are granted only if the Subject associated with the
current access control context contains <i>all</i> of those Principals.

<p>To grant the same set of permissions to different Principals,
create multiple <code>grant</code> statements where each lists 
the permissions and contains a single Principal field designating one of the 
Principals.

<p>The policy file for this tutorial includes one <code>grant</code>
statement with a Principal field:

<blockquote>
<pre>
grant codebase "file:./SampleAction.jar",
    Principal javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosPrincipal 
        "your_user_name@your_realm"  {

   permission java.util.PropertyPermission "java.home", "read";
   permission java.util.PropertyPermission "user.home", "read";
   permission java.io.FilePermission "foo.txt", "read";
};
</pre>
</blockquote>

where you substitute your Kerberos user name (complete with "@" and realm)
for "<code>your_user_name@your_realm</code>".

<p>This specifies that the indicated permissions are granted
to the specified principal executing the code in
<code>SampleAction.jar</code>.

</blockquote>


<a name="AssocSubject">
<H3>How Do You Associate a Subject with an Access Control 
Context?</H3></a>

<blockquote>

<p>To create and associate a Subject with an 
access control context, you need the following:

<ul>

<li>The user must first be authenticated, as described in
<a href="AcnOnly.html">JAAS Authentication</a>. <p>

<li>The static <code>doAs</code> method from the
Subject class must be called, passing it an authenticated
Subject and a 
<a href="../../../../api/java/security/PrivilegedAction.html">
java.security.PrivilegedAction</a> or
<a href="../../../../api/java/security/PrivilegedExceptionAction.html">
java.security.PrivilegedExceptionAction</a>. (See 
<a href="../../doprivileged.html">API for 
Privileged Blocks</a> for a comparison of PrivilegedAction and 
PrivilegedExceptionAction.) The <code>doAs</code> method 
associates the provided Subject with the current access control context
and then invokes the <code>run</code> method from the action.
The <code>run</code> method implementation contains all the code
to be executed as the specified Subject.
The action thus executes as the specified Subject.

<p>The static <code>doAsPrivileged</code> method from the Subject class may be 
called instead of the <code>doAs</code> method.  In addition to the parameters
passed to <code>doAs</code>, <code>doAsPrivileged</code> requires a third 
parameter: an AccessControlContext.  Unlike <code>doAs</code>, which associates
the provided Subject with the current access control context,
<code>doAsPrivileged</code> associates the Subject with the provided
access control context. See <a href="../../jaas/JAASRefGuide.html#doAsComp">
doAs vs. doAsPrivileged</a> in the JAAS Reference Guide for a comparison of 
those methods.

</ul>


</blockquote>

<a name="AznCode">
<H2>The Authorization Tutorial Code</H2></a>

<blockquote>

<p>The code for this tutorial consists of two files:

<ul>

<li><a href = "JaasAzn.java">JaasAzn.java</a> is exactly the same 
as the <code>JaasAcn.java</code> from the
<a href="AcnOnly.html">JAAS Authentication</a> tutorial
except for the additional code needed to call
<code>Subject.doAsPrivileged</code>. <p>

<li><a href = "SampleAction.java">SampleAction.java</a>
contains the SampleAction class. This class implements 
PrivilegedAction and has a <code>run</code> method that contains all the
code we want to be executed with Principal-based authorization checks.

</ul>

<H3>JaasAzn.java</H3>

<blockquote>

<p><a href = "JaasAzn.java">JaasAzn.java</a> is exactly the same as the
<code>JaasAcn.java</code> code used in the previous tutorial except with
three statements added at the end of the <code>main</code> method, after the
authentication is done. These statements result in (1) association of a Subject 
representing the authenticated user with the current access control context and 
(2) execution of the code in the <code>run</code> method of SampleAction. 
Associating the Subject with the access control context enables 
security-sensitive operations in the SampleAction <code>run</code> method 
(and any code it invokes directly or indirectly) to be executed if 
a Principal representing the authenticated user 
is granted the required permissions in the current policy.

<p>Like <code>JaasAcn.java</code>, <code>JaasAzn.java</code> instantiates a 
LoginContext <code>lc</code> and calls its <code>login</code> method to 
perform the authentication. If successful, the authenticated Subject 
(which includes a Principal representing the user) is 
obtained by calling the LoginContext's <code>getSubject</code> method:

<blockquote>
<pre>
Subject mySubject = lc.getSubject();
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>main</code> method then calls <code>Subject.doAsPrivileged</code>,
passing it the authenticated Subject <code>mySubject</code>, 
a PrivilegedAction (SampleAction) and a <code>null</code>
AccessControlContext, as described in the following.

<p>The SampleAction class is instantiated via the following:

<blockquote>
<pre>
PrivilegedAction action = new SampleAction();
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The call to <code>Subject.doAsPrivileged</code> is performed via:

<blockquote>
<pre>
Subject.doAsPrivileged(mySubject, action, null);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>doAsPrivileged</code> method invokes execution 
of the <code>run</code> method in the PrivilegedAction <code>action</code> 
(SampleAction) to initiate execution of the rest of the code, which 
is considered to be executed on behalf of the Subject <code>mySubject</code>.

<p>Passing <code>null</code> as the AccessControlContext (third)
argument to <code>doAsPrivileged</code> indicates
that <code>mySubject</code> should be associated with a new empty
AccessControlContext.  The result is that security checks
occurring during execution of SampleAction will only require
permissions for the SampleAction code itself (or other code it invokes),
running as <code>mySubject</code>.  
Note that the caller of <code>doAsPrivileged</code>
(and the callers on the execution stack at the time
<code>doAsPrivileged</code> was called) do not require any permissions
while the action executes.



</blockquote>


<a name="SACode">
<H3>SampleAction.java</H3></a>

<blockquote>

<p><a href = "SampleAction.java">SampleAction.java</a> contains the 
SampleAction class. This class implements 
<code>java.security.PrivilegedAction</code>
and has a <code>run</code> method that contains all the
code we want to be executed as the Subject <code>mySubject</code>.
For this tutorial, we will perform three operations, each of which cannot
be done unless code has been granted required permissions. We will:

<ul>

<li>Read and print the value of the <code>java.home</code> system property, <p>

<li>Read and print the value of the <code>user.home</code> system property, 
and <p>

<li>Determine whether or not a file named <code>foo.txt</code> exists in
the current directory.

</ul>

<p>Here is the code:

<blockquote>
<pre>
import java.io.File;
import java.security.PrivilegedAction;

public class <b>SampleAction</b> implements PrivilegedAction {

  public Object <b>run</b>() {

    System.out.println("\nYour java.home property value is: "
                + System.getProperty("java.home"));

    System.out.println("\nYour user.home property value is: "
                + System.getProperty("user.home"));

    File f = new File("foo.txt");
    System.out.print("\nfoo.txt does ");
    if (!f.exists())
        System.out.print("not ");
    System.out.println("exist in the current working directory.");
    return null;
  }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>


</blockquote>

</blockquote>


<a name="AznLCF">
<H2>The Login Configuration File</H2></a>

<blockquote>

<p>The login configuration file used for this tutorial can be
exactly the same as that used by the 
<a href="AcnOnly.html">JAAS Authentication</a> tutorial.
Thus we can use 
<a href = "jaas.conf">jaas.conf</a>, which contains just one
entry:

<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>JaasSample {
  com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required;
};</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This entry is named "JaasSample" and that is the name that both our
tutorial applications <code>JaasAcn</code> and <code>JaasAzn</code>
use to refer to it.
The entry specifies that the LoginModule to be used to do the
user authentication is the Krb5LoginModule in the 
<code>com.sun.security.auth.module</code> package and that
this Krb5LoginModule is required to "succeed" in order for
authentication to be considered successful.
The Krb5LoginModule succeeds only if the name and password supplied
by the user are successfully used to log the user into the Kerberos KDC.


</blockquote>



<a name="AznPF">
<H2>The Policy File</H2></a>

<blockquote>

<p>This authorization tutorial contains two classes,
<code>JaasAzn</code> and <code>SampleAction</code>. The code in 
each class contains some security-sensitive operations and thus 
relevant permissions are required in a policy file in order for
the operations to be executed.


<H3>Permissions Required by JaasAzn</H3>

<blockquote>

<p>The main method of the <code>JaasAzn</code> class does two operations for
which permissions are required. It

<ul>

<li>creates a LoginContext, and <p>

<li>calls the <code>doAsPrivileged</code> static method of the Subject class.

</ul>

<p>The LoginContext creation is exactly the same as was done in the
authentication tutorial, and it thus needs the same 
<code>javax.security.auth.AuthPermission</code> permission with target
"<code>createLoginContext.JaasSample</code>".

<p>In order to call the <code>doAsPrivileged</code> method of the Subject class,
you need to have a <code>javax.security.auth.AuthPermission</code> with
target "<code>doAsPrivileged</code>".

<p>Assuming the <code>JaasAzn</code> class is placed in a JAR file named
<code>JaasAzn.jar</code>, these permissions can be granted to the 
<code>JaasAzn</code> code via the following <code>grant</code> statement 
in the policy file:

<blockquote>
<pre>
grant codebase "file:./JaasAzn.jar" {
   permission javax.security.auth.AuthPermission 
                    "createLoginContext.JaasSample";
   permission javax.security.auth.AuthPermission "doAsPrivileged";
};
</pre>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>


<a name="SampleActionPerms"></a>
<H3>Permissions Required by SampleAction</H3>

<blockquote>

<p><p>The <code>SampleAction</code> code does three operations for
which permissions are required. It

<ul>

<li>reads the value of the "java.home" system property. <p>

<li>reads the value of the "user.home" system property. <p>

<li>checks to see whether or not a file named <code>foo.txt</code> exists
in the current directory.

</ul>

<p>The permissions required for these operations are the following:

<blockquote>
<pre>
permission java.util.PropertyPermission "java.home", "read";
permission java.util.PropertyPermission "user.home", "read";
permission java.io.FilePermission "foo.txt", "read";
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>We need to grant these permissions to the code in 
<code>SampleAction.class</code>, which we will place in a 
JAR file named <code>SampleAction.jar</code>. 
However, for this particular <code>grant</code> statement we want to
grant the permissions not just to the <i>code</i> but to a specific
user executing the code, to demonstrate how to restrict access to
a particular user. 

<p>Thus, as explained in <a href="#UserPFStmts">How Do You Make Principal-Based 
Policy File Statements?</a>,
our <code>grant</code> statement looks like the following:

<blockquote>
<pre>
grant codebase "file:./SampleAction.jar",
    Principal javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosPrincipal 
        "your_user_name@your_realm"  {

   permission java.util.PropertyPermission "java.home", "read";
   permission java.util.PropertyPermission "user.home", "read";
   permission java.io.FilePermission "foo.txt", "read";
};
</pre>
</blockquote>

You substitute your Kerberos user name (complete with "@" and realm)
for "<code>your_user_name@your_realm</code>". For example, if your 
user name is "mjones" and your realm is "KRBNT-OPERATIONS.ABC.COM",
you would use "mjones@KRBNT-OPERATIONS.ABC.COM" (complete with the quotes).

<a name="RunAzn">
<H2>Running the Authorization Tutorial Code</H2></a>

<blockquote>

<p>To execute our JAAS authorization tutorial code, all you
have to do is 

<ol>

<li>Place the following files into a directory: <p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href = "JaasAzn.java">JaasAzn.java</a> source file.
<li>The <a href = "SampleAction.java">SampleAction.java</a> source file.
<li>The <a href = "jaas.conf">jaas.conf</a> login configuration file.
<li>The <a href = "jaasazn.policy">jaasazn.policy</a> policy file.
</ul>

<p>

<li>Replace "your_user_name@your_realm" in <code>jaasazn.policy</code> 
with your user name and realm. <p>

<li>Compile <code>SampleAction.java</code> and <code>JaasAzn.java</code>:

<blockquote>
<pre>
javac SampleAction.java JaasAzn.java
</pre>
</blockquote>

<li>Create a JAR file named <code>JaasAzn.jar</code> containing 
<code>JaasAzn.class</code>:

<blockquote>
<pre>
jar -cvf JaasAzn.jar JaasAzn.class
</pre>
</blockquote>

<li>Create a JAR file named <code>SampleAction.jar</code> containing 
<code>SampleAction.class</code>:

<blockquote>
<pre>
jar -cvf SampleAction.jar SampleAction.class
</pre>
</blockquote>


<li>Execute the <code>JaasAzn</code> application, specifying <p>

<ol>

<li>by an appropriate <code>-classpath</code> clause that classes should be 
searched for in the <code>JaasAzn.jar</code> and <code>SampleAction.jar</code>
JAR files, <p>

<li>by <code>-Djava.security.manager</code> that a
security manager should be installed, <p>

<li>by <code>-Djava.security.krb5.realm=&lt;your_realm&gt;</code> that 
your Kerberos realm is the one specified.<p>

<li>by <code>-Djava.security.krb5.kdc=&lt;your_kdc&gt;</code> that 
your Kerberos KDC is the one specified.<p>

<li>by <code>-Djava.security.policy=jaasazn.policy</code> that
the policy file to be used is <code>jaasazn.policy</code>, and <p>

<li>by <code>-Djava.security.auth.login.config=jaas.conf</code> that the
login configuration file to be used is <code>jaas.conf</code>.

</ol>

<p>Below are the full commands to use for both Microsoft Windows and Unix systems.
The only difference is that on Windows systems you use semicolons to
separate classpath items, while you use colons for that purpose on
Unix systems.  <b>Be sure to replace 
<code>&lt;your_realm&gt;</code> with your Kerberos realm,
and <code>&lt;your_kdc&gt;</code> with your Kerberos KDC.</b>

<p>Here is the full command for Windows systems:

<blockquote>
<pre>
java -classpath JaasAzn.jar;SampleAction.jar 
 -Djava.security.manager 
 -Djava.security.krb5.realm=&lt;your_realm&gt; 
 -Djava.security.krb5.kdc=&lt;your_kdc&gt; 
 -Djava.security.policy=jaasazn.policy 
 -Djava.security.auth.login.config=jaas.conf JaasAzn
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the full command for UNIX systems:

<blockquote>
<pre>
java -classpath JaasAzn.jar:SampleAction.jar 
 -Djava.security.manager 
 -Djava.security.krb5.realm=&lt;your_realm&gt; 
 -Djava.security.krb5.kdc=&lt;your_kdc&gt; 
 -Djava.security.policy=jaasazn.policy 
 -Djava.security.auth.login.config=jaas.conf JaasAzn
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Type the full command on one line. Multiple lines are used here 
for legibility. If the command is too long for your system, you may
need to place it in a .bat file (for Windows) or a .sh file
(for UNIX) and then run that file to execute the command.

<p>You will be prompted for your Kerberos user name and password,
and the underlying Kerberos authentication mechanism 
specified in the login configuration file will log you into
Kerberos. If your login is successful, you will see the 
message "Authentication succeeded!" and if not, you will see
"Authentication Failed." 

<p>For login troubleshooting suggestions, see 
<a href = "Troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting</a>.

<p>Once authentication is successfully completed,
the rest of the program (in <code>SampleAction</code>) will be executed
on behalf of you, the user, requiring you to have been granted
appropriate permissions. The <code>jaasazn.policy</code> policy file
grants you the required permissions, so you will see a display of
the values of your <code>java.home</code> and <code>user.home</code>
system properties and a statement as to whether or not you have a file named
<code>foo.txt</code> in the current directory.
