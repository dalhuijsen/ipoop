1.0 Starting out</H2>
<P>
One of the most significant capabilities of the Java<sup><font
size=-2>TM</font></sup> platform is the ability to dynamically download
Java software from any Uniform Resource Locator (URL) to a Java virtual
machine* (JVM) running in a separate process, usually on a different
physical system. The result is that a remote system can run a program,
for example an applet, which has never been installed on its disk. For
the first few sections of this document, codebase with regard to
applets will be discussed in order to help describe codebase with
regard to Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI).
<P>
For example, a JVM running from within a web browser can download the
bytecodes for subclasses of <code>java.applet.Applet</code> and any
other classes needed by that applet. The system on which the browser is
running has most likely never run this applet before, nor installed it
on its disk.  Once all the necessary classes have been downloaded from
the server, the browser can start the execution of the applet program
using the local resources of the system on which the client browser is
running.
<P>
Java RMI takes advantage of this capability to download and execute
classes and on systems where those classes have never been installed on
disk.  Using the RMI API any JVM, not only those in browsers, can
download any Java class file including specialized RMI stub classes,
which enable the execution of method calls on a remote server using the
server system's resources.
<P>
The notion of a codebase originates from the use of <code CLASS="Code">
ClassLoader</code>s in the Java programming language. When a Java
program uses a <code CLASS="Code">ClassLoader</code>, that class loader
needs to know the location(s) from which it should be allowed to load
classes. Usually, a class loader is used in conjunction with an HTTP
server that is serving up compiled classes for the Java platform.  Most
likely, the first <code CLASS="Code">ClassLoader</code>/codebase
pairing that you came into contact with was the <code
CLASS="Code">AppletClassLoader</code>, and the &quot;codebase&quot;
part of the <code CLASS="Code">&lt;applet&gt;</code> HTML tag, so this
tutorial will assume that you have some experience with Java RMI
programming, as well as writing HTML files that contain applet tags.
For example, the HTML source will contain something like:

<pre>
&lt;applet height=100 width=100 codebase=&quot;myclasses/&quot; code=&quot;My.class&quot;&gt;
	&lt;param name=&quot;ticker&quot;&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;
</pre>
<p>


<a name="section2"></a>

<H2>
2.0 What is a codebase?</H2>
<P>
A codebase can be defined as a source, or a place, from which to load
classes into a Java virtual machine. For example, if you invited a new
friend over for dinner, you would need to give that friend directions
to the place where you lived, so that he or she could locate your
house. Similarly, you can think of a codebase as the directions that
you give to a JVM, so it can find your [potentially remote]
classes.
<P>
You can think of your <code CLASS="Code">CLASSPATH</code> as a
&quot;local codebase&quot;, because it is the list of places on disk
from which you load local classes. When loading classes from a local
disk-based source, your <code CLASS="Code">CLASSPATH</code>
variable is consulted. Your <code CLASS="Code">CLASSPATH</code> can
be set to take either relative or absolute path names to directories
and/or archives of class files. So just as <code CLASS="Code">CLASSPATH</code> is a kind of &quot;local codebase&quot;, the codebase
used by applets and remote objects can be thought of as a &quot;remote
codebase&quot;.


<a name="section3"></a>

<H2>
3.0 How does it work?</H2>
<H3>
3.1 How codebase is used in applets </H3>
<p>
To interact with an applet, that applet and any classes that it needs
to run must be accessible by remote clients. While applets can be
accessed from &quot;<code>ftp://</code>&quot; or local
&quot;<code>file:///</code>&quot; URLs, they are usually accessed from
a remote HTTP server. 
<OL>
	<LI>The client browser requests an applet class that is not
	found in the client's <code CLASS="Code">CLASSPATH</code></LI>

	<LI>The class definition of the applet (and any other class(es)
	that it needs) is downloaded from the server to the client
	using HTTP</LI>

	<LI>The applet executes on the client</LI>
</OL>
<center>
<IMG SRC="images/codebase-1.gif" ALT="illustrates three steps above">
<p>Figure 1: Downloading applets

</center>

<P>

The applet's codebase is always relative to the URL of the HTML page in
which the <code CLASS="Code">&lt;applet&gt;</code> tag is contained.
</P>

<H3>
3.2 How codebase is used in RMI</H3>
<p>
Using RMI, applications can create remote objects that accept method
calls from clients in other JVMs. In order for a client to call methods
on a remote object, the client must have a way to communicate with the
remote object. Rather than having to program the client to speak the
remote object's protocol, RMI uses special classes called stubs that
can be downloaded to the client that are used to communicate with (make
method calls on) the remote object. The
<code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code> property value represents one or
more URL locations from which these stubs (and any classes needed by
the stubs) can be downloaded. </P>

<P>
Like applets, the classes needed to execute remote method calls can be
downloaded from &quot;<code CLASS="Code">file:///</code>&quot; URLs,
but like applets, a &quot;<code CLASS="Code">file:///</code>&quot; URL
generally requires that the client and the server reside on the same
physical host, unless the file system referred to by the URL is made
available using some other protocol, such as NFS.</P>

<p>
Generally, the classes needed to execute remote method calls should be
made accessible from a network resource, such as an HTTP or FTP
server.</P>

<P>
Figure 2: Downloading RMI stubs</P>
</center>

<OL>
	<LI>The remote object's codebase is specified by the remote
	object's server by setting the
	<code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code> property. The RMI server
	registers a remote object, bound to a name, with the RMI
	registry. The codebase set on the server JVM is annotated to
	the remote object reference in the RMI registry.</LI>
	<p>
	<LI>The RMI client requests a reference to a named remote
	object. The reference (the remote object's stub instance) is
	what the client will use to make remote method calls to the
	remote object. </LI>
	<p>
	<LI>The RMI registry returns a reference (the stub instance) to
	the requested class. If the class definition for the stub
	instance can be found locally in the client's <code
	CLASS="Code">CLASSPATH</code> , which is always searched before
	the codebase, the client will load the class locally. However,
	if the definition for the stub is not found in the client's
	<code>CLASSPATH</code>, the client will attempt to retrieve the
	class definition from the remote object's codebase.</LI>
	<p>
	<LI>The client requests the class definition from the codebase.
	The codebase the client uses is the URL that was annotated to
	the stub instance when the stub class was loaded by the
	registry. Back in step 1, the annotated stub for the exported
	object was then registered with the RMI registry bound to a
	name.</LI>
	<p>
	<LI>The class definition for the stub (and any other class(es) 
	that it needs) is downloaded to the client.</LI>

<blockquote>
	<b>Note:</b><i> Steps 4 and 5 are the sames steps that the
	registry took to load the remote object class, when the remote
	object was bound to a name in (registered with) the RMI
	registry. When the registry attempted to load the remote
	object's stub class, it requested the class definition from the
	codebase associated with that remote object.</i>
</blockquote>

	<li>Now the client has all the information that it needs to
	invoke remote methods on the remote object. The stub instance
	acts as a proxy to the remote object that exists on the server;
	so unlike the applet which uses a codebase to execute code in
	its local JVM, the RMI client uses the remote object's codebase
	to execute code in another, potentially remote JVM, as
	illustrated in Figure 3:

<a name="section4"></a>

<H2>
4.0 Using codebase in RMI for more than just stub downloading</H2>
<P>
In addition to downloading stubs and their associated classes to
clients, the <code CLASS="Code">java.rmi.server.codebase</code>
 property can be used to specify a location from which any class, not
 only stubs, can be downloaded. </P>
<p>
When a client makes a method call to a remote object, the method that
it calls could be written to accept no arguments or a number of
arguments. There are three distinct cases that may occur, based on the
data type(s) of the method argument(s). </P>
<P>
In the first case, all of the method parameters (and return value) are
primitive data types, so the remote object knows how to interpret them
as method parameters, and there is no need to check its <code
CLASS="Code">CLASSPATH</code> or any codebase. </P>
<p>
In the second case, at least one remote method parameter or the return
value is an object, for which the remote object can find the class
definition locally in its <code CLASS="Code">CLASSPATH</code>.</P>
<P>
In the third case (shown as Step 6, in Figure 4), the remote method
receives an object instance, for which the remote object cannot find
the class definition locally in its <code>CLASSPATH</code>. This type
of remote method call is illustrated in Figure 4. The class of the
object sent by the client will be a subtype of the declared parameter
type. A subtype is either:
<ul>
	<li>An implementation of the interface that is declared as the
	method parameter (or return) type
	<p>
	<LI>A subclass of the class that is declared as the method
	parameter (or return) type</LI>
</UL>

<IMG SRC="images/codebase-4.gif" ALT="Illustrates passing an unknown
 subtype as a method parameter, as described above and below.">
<P>Figure 4: RMI client making a remote method call, passing an unknown
subtype as a method parameter</P>
</center>

<p>
7. Like the applet's codebase, the client-specified codebase is
used to download <code CLASS="Code">Remote</code> classes, non-remote
classes, and interfaces to other JVMs. If the <code>codebase</code>
property is set on the client application, then that codebase is
annotated to the subtype instance when the subtype class is loaded by
the client. If the codebase is not set on the client, the remote object
will mistakenly use its own codebase.

<a name="section5"></a>

<H2>
5.0 Command-line examples</H2>
<p>
In the case of an applet, the applet codebase value is embedded in an
HTML page, as we saw in the HTML example in the first section of this
tutorial.</P>
<P>
In the case of Java RMI codebase, rather than having a reference to the
class embedded in an HTML page, the client first contacts the RMI
registry for a reference to the remote object. Because the remote
object's codebase can refer to any URL, not just one that is relative
to a known URL, the value of the RMI codebase must be an absolute URL
to the location of the stub class and any other classes needed by the
stub class. This value of the <code>codebase</code> property can refer
to:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>The URL of a directory in which the classes are organized
	in package-named sub-directories</LI>
	<p>
	<LI>The URL of a JAR file in which the classes are organized in
	package-named directories</LI>
	<p>
	<LI>A space-delimited string containing multiple instances of
	JAR files and/or directories that meet the criteria above</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<b>Note:</b> When the <code>codebase</code> property value is set to
the URL of a <i>directory</i>, the value must be terminated by a
&quot;/&quot;. 

<h4>
Examples</h4>
<p>
If the location of your downloadable classes is on an HTTP server named
&quot;webvector&quot;, in the directory &quot;export&quot; (under the
web root), your <code>codebase</code> property setting might look like
this:
<pre>
	-Djava.rmi.server.codebase=http://webvector/export/</pre>
<P>
If the location of your downloadable classes is on an HTTP server named
&quot;webline&quot;, in a JAR file named &quot;mystuff.jar&quot;, in
the directory &quot;public&quot; (under the web root), your
<code>codebase</code> property setting might look like this:</P>
<pre>
	-Djava.rmi.server.codebase=http://webline/public/mystuff.jar</pre>
<P>
Now let's suppose that the location of your downloadable classes has
been split between two JAR files, &quot;myStuff.jar&quot; and
&quot;myOtherStuff.jar&quot;. If these JAR files are located on
different servers (named &quot;webfront&quot; and &quot;webwave&quot;),
your <code>codebase</code> property setting might look like this:
<pre>
	-Djava.rmi.server.codebase=&quot;http://webfront/myStuff.jar http://webwave/myOtherStuff.jar&quot;</pre>

<H2>
6.0 Troubleshooting tips</H2>
<P>
Any serializable class, including RMI stubs, can be downloaded if your RMI programs are configured properly. Here are the conditions under which dynamic stub downloading will work:</P>
<OL>
	<li type=A>The stub class and any of the classes that the stub relies
	on are served up from a URL reachable from the client.
	<p>

	<li type=A>The <code
	CLASS="Code">java.rmi.server.codebase</code> property has been
	set on the server program (or in the case of activation, the
	&quot;setup&quot; program) that makes the call to <code
	CLASS="Code">bind</code> or <code CLASS="Code">rebind</code>,
	such that:

	<p>
	<UL>
		<LI>The value of the <code>codebase</code> property is
		the URL in step A
		<P>
		and
		<p>
		<LI>If the URL specified as the value of the
		<code>codebase</code> property is a directory, it must
		end in a trailing &quot;/&quot;

	</UL>
	<p>
	<a name="sixStepC"></a>
	<li type=A>The <code CLASS="Code">rmiregistry</code> cannot
	find the stub class or any of the classes that the stub relies
	on in its <code CLASS="Code">CLASSPATH</code>. This is so the
	codebase gets annotated to the stub when the registry does its
	class load of the stub, as a result of calls to <code
	CLASS="Code">bind</code> or <code CLASS="Code">rebind</code> in
	the server or setup code.
	<p>
	<li type=A>The client has installed a <code
	CLASS="Code">SecurityManager</code> that allows the stub to be
	downloaded. In the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, v1.2 and later
	this means that the client must also have a properly configured
	security policy file.

</OL>

<P>
There are two common problems associated with the <code
CLASS="Code">java.rmi.server.codebase</code> property, which are
discussed next.

<H3 CLASS="Heading2">
6.1 If you encounter a problem running your RMI server</H3>
<P>
The first problem you might encounter is the receipt of a <code
CLASS="Code">ClassNotFoundException</code> when attempting to <code
CLASS="Code">bind</code> or <code CLASS="Code">rebind</code> a remote
object to a name in the registry. This exception is usually due to a
malformed <code CLASS="Code">codebase</code> property, resulting in the
registry not being able to locate the remote object's stubs or other
classes needed by the stub. </P>

<p>
It is important to note that the remote object's stub implements all
the same interfaces as the remote object itself, so those interfaces,
as well as any other custom classes declared as method parameters or
return values, must also be available for download from the specified
codebase.</P>

<P>
Most frequently, this exception is thrown as a result of omitting the
trailing slash from the URL value of the property. Other reasons would
include: the value of the property is not a URL; the path to the
classes specified in the URL is incorrect or misspelled; the stub class
or any other necessary classes are not all available from the specified
URL.</P>

<P>The exception that you may encounter in such a case would look like this:

<pre>
java.rmi.ServerException: RemoteException occurred in server thread; nested exception is: 
	java.rmi.UnmarshalException: error unmarshalling arguments; nested exception is:
	java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: examples.callback.MessageReceiverImpl_Stub

RemoteException occurred in server thread; nested exception is:

	java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: examples.callback.MessageReceiverImpl_Stub
</pre>

<H3 CLASS="Heading2">
6.2 If you encounter a problem running your RMI client</H3>
<P>
The second problem you could encounter is the receipt of a <code
CLASS="Code">ClassNotFoundException</code> when attempting to <code
CLASS="Code">lookup</code> a remote object in the registry. If you
receive this exception in a stacktrace resulting from an attempt to run
your RMI client code, then your problem is the <code
CLASS="Code">CLASSPATH</code> with which your RMI registry was started.
See <a href="#sixStepC">requirement C in section 6.0</a>. Here is what
the exception will look like:</P>

<pre>
java.rmi.UnmarshalException: Return value class not found; nested exception is:
	java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: MyImpl_Stub
	at sun.rmi.registry.RegistryImpl_Stub.lookup(RegistryImpl_Stub.java:109
	at java.rmi.Naming.lookup(Naming.java:60)
	at RmiClient.main(MyClient.java:28)
