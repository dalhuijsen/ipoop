This appendix documents the known applet compatibility issues between the Microsoft 
VM (Virtual Machine) and Sun's Java 2 VM. <BR>
<h3><code>ClassFormatError</code></h3>
<p>This problem is caused by bytecode generated from old JDK 1.0.2 or 1.1 compilers, 
  which generate bytecode that does not conform to the Java VM Specification. 
  Since the verifiers in recent J2SE releases are much stricter about bad class 
  format, <code>ClassFormatError</code> is thrown by the VM when these bad class 
  files are loaded.</p>
<p>To allow some applets with bad class file format to run in Java 2, a bytecode 
  transformer is put into the Java Plug-in to transform some of the bad class 
  files to good ones. Currently only bad class files with the following <code>ClassFormatError</code> 
  may be transformed:<BR>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Local variable name has bad constant pool index </li>
  <li>Extra bytes at the end of the class file </li>
  <li>Code segment has wrong length </li>
  <li>Illegal field/method name </li>
  <li>Illegal field/method modifiers </li>
  <li>Invalid start_pc/length in local var table </li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, the following <code>ClassFormatError</code> is not fixable by 
  the bytecode transformer, so any class file that has any of these known problems 
  will not run under Java 2:<BR>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Illegal use of nonvirtual function call </li>
  <li>Arguments can't fit into locals </li>
  <li>Unsorted lookup switch </li>
  <li>Truncated class file<BR>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Security exception with <code>sun.audio</code></h3>
<p>The <code>sun.audio</code> package was accessible by applets in JDK 1.1. However, 
  the applet sandbox was closed up in Java 2, so that applets that try to access 
  any class libraries in the <code>sun.audio</code> package will result in a <code>SecurityException</code>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To provide maximum applet compatibility, the applet sandbox in Java Plug-in 
  has been opened up to allow applets to access the <code>sun.audio</code> package 
  again.
</p>
<h3><B>Unable to find resources from <code>AppletContext.getAudioClip()</code> 
  and <code>AppletContext.getImage()</code></B> </h3>
<p>The resource-lookup sequence in <code>AppletContext.getImage()</code> and <code>AppletContext.getAudioClip()</code> 
  is different in the Microsoft and Sun implementations.&nbsp;<BR>
  <BR>
  In the Microsoft VM, resources are looked up in the following sequence:<BR>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Archives specified through HTML <code>archive</code> or <code>cabbase</code> 
    parameters </li>
  <li><code>codebase</code> URL </li>
</ol>
<p> In Sun's implementation, resources are looked up according to <code>codebase</code> 
  URL.</p>
<p> As a result, some applets that rely on the resources-lookup sequence in the 
  Microsoft VM may not load resources properly in Java 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To provide maximum applet compatibility, the resources-lookup sequence in Java 
  Plug-in has been changed to the following:<BR>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Archives specified through HTML <code>archive</code> parameters </li>
  <li><code>codebase</code> URL<BR>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3><B><code>ClassLoader</code> sharing policy</B></h3>
<p><code>ClassLoader</code> sharing policy is different in the Microsoft and Sun 
  implementations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Microsoft VM, the <code>ClassLoader</code> object is shared between 
  applets if and only if all of the following are true:<BR>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>codebase</code> values are the same</li>
  <li><code>archive</code> values are the same</li>
  <li><code>cabbase</code> values are the same</li>
</ul>
<p>In Sun's implementation, a <code>ClassLoader</code> object is shared between 
  applets if and only if:<BR>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>codebase</code> values are the same </li>
</ul>
<p>Some applets relying on the <code>ClassLoader</code> sharing policy in the 
  Microsoft VM may not run properly in Java 2 because of potential class definition 
  conflicts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To provide maximum applet compatibility, the <code>ClassLoader</code> sharing 
  policy in Java Plug-in has been changed to the following requirements:<BR>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>codebase</code> values are the same and </li>
  <li><code>cache_archive</code> values are the same and </li>
  <li><code>java_archive</code> values are the same and </li>
  <li><code>archive</code> values are the same<BR>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><B>Security model&#151;Java 2 Versus Microsoft</B> </h3>
<p>Java 2 has a new security model providing much more capability and flexibility 
  than JDK 1.1 provides. The Microsoft VM security model is based on JDK 1.1 and 
  its own propriety technologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue is not fixable, so applets that rely on the Microsoft's security 
  model will not run properly in Java 2.<BR>
</p>
<h3><B>Applet packaging</B></h3>
<p>Applet packaging in Java 2 and JDK 1.1 is through the <code>.jar</code> file. 
  However, Microsoft's VM supports applet packaging through <code>.jar</code> 
  file and its own propriety <code>.cab</code><I> </I>(cabinet) file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue is not fixable, so applets packaged in Microsoft's <code>.cab</code> 
  file format will not load in Java 2.<BR>
</p>
<h3>Java language specification strictness (<code>null</code> versus zero-length 
  <code>String</code>)</h3>
<p>In JDK 1.1, the Java language specification was loose in dealing with <code>null</code> 
  and zero-length strings in the class libraries. Some APIs may treat <code>null</code> 
  as a zero-length <code>String</code>, while some other APIs may treat <code>null</code> 
  as it is. In Java 2, the Java language specification has been tightened up to 
  specify what the exact behavior should be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue is not fixable, so applets that rely on the APIs to treat <code>null</code> 
  as a zero-length <code>String</code> may result in an exception in Java 2.<BR>
</p>
<h3>Applet signing&#151;RSA versus Authenticode</h3>
<p>In Java 2, applet signing is supported through RSA and the <code>.jar</code> 
  file, while Microsoft supports applet signing through its own proprietary Authenticode 
  and <code>.cab</code> technologies.</p>
<p>This issue is not fixable, so signed applets that rely on Microsoft's Authenticode 
  and <code>.cab</code> technologies may not load properly in Java 2.<BR>
</p>
<h3>Implementation changes in AWT class libraries</h3>
<p>In JDK 1.1, AWT class libraries were used by developers as thread-safe libraries; 
  i.e., applets may perform lots of actions through the AWT in multiple threads 
  and assume the class libraries will take care of synchronization issues. In 
  Java 2, the AWT class libraries implementation has been changed to guarantee 
  thread safety only when it is called by the AWT event-dispatch thread.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue is not fixable, so applets in Java 2 that make calls to AWT class 
  libraries without awareness of the thread-safety issue may result in deadlock 
  or race conditions.<BR>
</p>
<h3>Java/JavaScript communication</h3>
<p>In the Microsoft implementation, applet methods and properties exposed in JavaScript 
  in an HTML page are exactly the same as the methods/fields of the applet object. 
  In Java Plug-in, applet methods and properties exposed in JavaScript in HTML 
  are obtained via JavaBeans Introspection, which analyzes methods and properties 
  through naming convention in the applet object. The side effect is that applet 
  fields are treated differently.</p>
<p>This problem will be fixed in future release of Java Plug-in. In the meantime, 
  JavaScript accessing fields in the applet object may not work properly in Java 
  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
</p>
<h3>Microsoft proprietary Java class libraries</h3>
<p>Microsoft has provided lots of proprietary class libraries in its VM implementation, 
  including J/Direct, AFC, WFC, etc.</p>
<p>This issue is not fixable, so applets that rely on any of the Microsoft proprietary 
  Java class libraries will not work properly in Java 2.<BR>
</p>
<h3>Whitespace characters in string returned from <code>Applet.getParameter()</code></h3>
<p>In the Microsoft implementation, whitespace characters are stripped off before 
  the string is returned to the applets in <code>Applet.getParameter()</code>. 
  However, the Sun implementation returns the string as it is specified in the 
  HTML parameters. As a result, some JDK 1.1 applets refuse to run in Java 2 because 
  the applet's logic doesn't take the whitespace into account.</p>
<p>To provide maximum applet compatibility, the implementation of <code>Applet.getParameter()</code> 
  in Java Plug-in has been changed to strip off whitespace characters in the return 
  value.<BR>
</p>
<h3>Design changes in <code>java.util.Hashtable.hashCode()</code>&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B></h3>
<p>In JDK 1.1, <code>Hashtable.hashCode()</code> was implemented based on object 
  identity, so that each <code>Hashtable</code> object returns&nbsp;its unique 
  value when <code>hashCode()</code> is called. In Java 2, implementation of <code>Hashtable.hashCode()</code> 
  was changed to be value-based as part of the Java Collection Framework. <code>Hashtable</code> 
  object returns its hashcode value based on the objects it contains.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This change breaks some JDK 1.1 applets if they add <code>Hashtable</code> 
  object into itself, as this breaks the fundamental design of the Collection 
  Framework and causes a <code>StackOverflowError</code>. It breaks the logic 
  in the code of some applets that rely on <code>Hashtable.hashCode()</code><I> 
  </I>to return a constant value from the same <code>Hashtable</code> object.</p>
<p>To provide maximum applet compatibility, the implementation of <code>Hashtable.hashCode()</code> 
  is changed to check for this special case and avoid stack overflow.<BR>
</p>
<h3>Accessing frame from applet</h3>
<p>To track mouse events or for other reasons, an applet may sometimes try to 
  access to its frame. In the Microsoft and Sun implementations, the number of 
  containers between the frame and the applet is different.</p>
<p>An applets that relies on the location of its frame being at a particular level 
  of containment in the Microsoft VM (without navigating the entire AWT hierarchical 
  component tree) is likely to fail in Java 2. The most common symptom is <code>ClassCastException</code> 
  from the AWT Dispatch Event Thread.</p>
<p>This issue is not fixable; thus an applets affected by this issue may not run 
  properly in Java 2.<BR>
</p>
<h3><code>MAYSCRIPT</code></h3>
<p>In Netscape Navigator and Java Plug-in, an applet accessing JavaScript is required 
  to specify the <code>MAYSCRIPT</code><I> </I>parameter in the applet tag. However, 
  the Microsoft implementation doesn't honor this parameter and allows applets 
  to access JavaScript under all conditions. Since most Internet applets target 
  the Microsoft VM, <code>MAYSCRIPT</code> is not specified in these applets.</p>
<p>To provide maximum applet compatibility, the <code>MAYSCRIPT</code> check has 
  been removed from Java Plug-in.<BR>
</p>
<h3>HTTP User-Agent</h3>
<p>In the Microsoft and Sun implementations, different HTTP User-Agent strings 
  are passed to the server when an HTTP connection is requested. Since most web 
  sites target the Microsoft VM instead of Sun's, these web sites do not recognize 
  Sun's HTTP User-Agent, and this may result in failure.</p>
<p>As a result, HTTP User-Agent used in Java Plug-in has been changed to be similar 
  to the one in the browser; thus most web servers will recognize requests made 
  from applets running in Java Plug-in.<BR>
</p>
<h3>Events during applet startup and shutdown</h3>
<p>In the Microsoft and Sun implementations, the events occurring during applet 
  startup and shutdown may not be exactly the same. For example, the logic in 
  the applet may rely on the applet being visible when <code>Applet.start()</code>/<code>Applet.stop()</code> 
  is called, which may be true in Microsoft's implementation but not in Sun's.</p>
<p>Applets that rely on specific events during applet startup or shutdown in Microsoft's 
  VM may not function properly in Java 2. The most common symptom is <code>NullPointerException</code> 
  from the AWT Dispatch Event Thread.</p>
<p>This issue is not fixable. <BR>
  <BR>
</p>
<h3>Java class libraries compatibility&nbsp;</h3>
<p>There are lots of changes in the Java class libraries in Java 2. Some APIs 
  are clarified, some are depreciated, and some other have been altered in implementation. 
  These following have caused some of the applets run in Microsoft's VM to fail 
  in Java 2:<BR>
</p>
<h4><code>java.awt.Graphics.drawString()</code></h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>drawString()</code> treats <code>null</code> as an empty string in 
    the Microsoft VM. In Java 2, <code>drawString()</code> treats <code>null</code> 
    as it is and throws <code>NullPointerException</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><code>java.awt.Graphics.drawImage()</code></h4>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>drawImage()</code> ignores<code> null</code> image in the Microsoft 
    VM. In Java 2, <code>drawImage()</code> treats <code>null</code> as it is 
    and throws <code>NullPointerException</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><code>java.awt.Color</code><I> </I>constructors</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>In the Microsoft VM, passing over-bound/under-bound values in the <code>Color</code> 
    constructor will cause the VM to print out a warning message in the console, 
    but the values will be reset to max/min automatically. In Java 2, <code>Color</code> 
    constructor checks for illegal values and throws <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><code>Thread.stop()</code>, <code>Thread.suspend()</code>, <code>Thread.resume()</code></h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>In the Microsoft VM, stopping, suspending, or resuming a dead thread will 
    cause the call to be ignored. In Java 2, calling these methods on a dead thread 
    will result in <code>AccessControlException</code>.</p>
  <p>All of these issues are fixable but have not yet been fixed. At this time, 
    applets affected by these issues will result in exceptions and may not run 
    properly in Java 2. </p>
</blockquote>
