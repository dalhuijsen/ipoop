<H2>How the Java Launcher Finds Classes</H2>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>The Java launcher, <B>java</B>, initiates the Java virtual machine. 
        The virtual machine searches for and loads classes in this order:

	<UL>
	<LI><B>Bootstrap classes</B> - Classes that comprise the Java platform, 
        including the classes in <CODE>rt.jar</CODE>
	and several other important jar files.
	<P>
	<LI><B>Extension classes</B> - Classes that use the Java Extension mechanism. 
        These are bundled as <CODE>.jar</CODE>
	files located in the extensions directory.
	<P>
	<LI><B>User classes</B> - Classes defined by developers and third parties that 
        do not take advantage of the extension mechanism. You identify the location of 
	these classes using the<TT> -classpath </TT>option on the command line
	the preferred method) or by using the CLASSPATH environment variable.  
        (See <b>Setting the Classpath</b> for <a href="windows/classpath.html">Windows</a> or 
        <a href="solaris/classpath.html">Solaris</a>.)
	</UL>

	<P>In effect, these three search paths are joined to form a simple class path. 
	This is similar to the &quot;flat&quot; class path previously used, but the
	current model has some important differences:

	<UL>
	<LI>It is relatively difficult to accidentally
	&quot;hide&quot; or omit the bootstrap classes.
	<P>
	<LI>In general, you only have to specify the location of user classes. 
	Bootstrap classes and extension classes are found &quot;automatically&quot;.
	<P>
	<LI>The tools classes are now in a separate archive (<TT>tools.jar</TT>) 
	and can only be used if included in the user class path (to be explained shortly).
	</UL>

	<P><A NAME="bootclass"></A>
	<H3>How the Java Launcher Finds Bootstrap Classes</H3>
	<P>Bootstrap classes are the classes that implement the Java
	2 Platform. Bootstrap classes are in the <CODE>rt.jar</CODE>
	and several other jar files in
	<CODE>jre/lib</CODE> directory. These archives are specified by
	the value of the bootstrap class path which is stored in the
	<CODE>sun.boot.class.path</CODE> system property. This system
	property is for reference only, and should not be directly
	modified.</P>

	<P>It is very unlikely that you will need to redefine the
	bootstrap class path. The nonstandard option,
	<B>-Xbootclasspath</B>, allows you to do so in those rare
	cicrcumstances in which it is necessary to use a different set
	of core classes.</P>

	<P>Note that the classes which implement the Java 2 SDK
	tools are in separate archive from the bootstrap classes.  The
	tools archive is the SDK's<CODE>/lib/tools.jar</CODE> file. The
	development tools add this archive to the user class path when
	invoking the launcher. However, this augmented user class path
	is only used to execute the tool. The tools that process
	source code, <B>javac</B> and <B>javadoc</B>, use the original
	class path, not the augmented version. (For more information,
	see <A HREF="#srcfiles">How Javac and Javadoc Find
	Classes</A>, below.) </P>

	<P><A NAME="extclass"></A>
        <H3>How the Java Launcher Finds Extension Classes</H3>
        <P>Extension classes are classes which
	extend the Java platform. Every <CODE>.jar</CODE> file in the
	extension directory, <tt>jre/lib/ext</tt>, is assumed to be an 
        extension and is loaded using the 
        <A HREF="../guide/extensions/index.html">Java Extension Framework</A>. 
        Loose class files in the extension directory will not be found. 
        They must be contained in a <tt>.jar</tt> file (or <tt>.zip</tt> 
        file). There is no option provided for changing the location of 
        the extension directory. <BR>
	</P>

        <P>
        If the <tt>jre/lib/ext</tt> directory contains multiple <code>.jar</code>
        files, and those files contain classes with the same name, such as:
        </P>

        <P>
        <CODE>
        smart-extension1_0.jar contains class smart.extension.Smart<BR>
        smart-extension1_1.jar contains class smart.extension.Smart<BR>
        </CODE>
        </P>
        <P>
        the class that actually gets loaded is undefined.
        </P>

	<P><A NAME="userclass"></A>
	<H3>How the Java Launcher Finds User Classes</H3>
	<P>User classes are classes which build on the Java
	platform. To find user classes, the launcher refers to the
	<I>user class path</I> -- a list of directories, JAR archives,
	and ZIP archives which contain class files.</P>

	<P>A class file has a subpath name that reflects the class's
	full-qualified name. For example, if the class
	<CODE>com.mypackage.MyClass</CODE> is stored under
	<CODE>/myclasses</CODE>, then <CODE>/myclasses</CODE> must be
	in the user class path and the full path to the class file
	must be
	/<CODE>myclasses/com/mypackage/MyClass.class</CODE>. If the
	class is stored in an archive named
	<CODE>myclasses.jar</CODE>, then <CODE>myclasses.jar</CODE>
	must be in the user class path, and the class file must be
	stored in the archive as
	<CODE>com/mypackage/MyClass.class</CODE>.</P>

	<P>The user class path is specified as a string,
	with a colon (<B><CODE>:</CODE></B>) separating the class path
	entries on Solaris, and a semi-colon (<B><CODE>;</CODE></B>) 
        separating entries on Microsoft Windows systems. 
        The <B>java</B> launcher puts the user class path
	string in the <CODE>java.class.path</CODE> system
	property. The possible sources of this value are:

	<UL>
	<LI>The default value, &quot;<B><CODE>.</CODE></B>&quot;,
	meaning that user class files are all class files in the
	current directory (or under it, if in a package).
	<P>
	<LI>The value of the <B>CLASSPATH</B> environment variable,
	which overrides the default value.
	<P>
	<LI>The value of the <B>-cp</B> or <B>-classpath</B> command
	line option, which overrides both the default value and the
	<B>CLASSPATH</B> value.
	<P>
	<LI>The JAR archive specified by the <B>-jar</B> option, which
	overrides all other values. If this option is used, all user
	classes come from the specified archive.
	</UL>

	<P><A NAME="jarclass"></A>
	<H3>How the Java Launcher Finds JAR-class-path Classes</H3>
	<P>A JAR file usually contains a "manifest" -- a file which lists the 
		contents of the JAR. The manifest can define a JAR-class-path, 
		which further extends the class path (but only while loading classes
		from that JAR). Classes accessed by a JAR-class-path are found in
 	        the following order:<ul>
		<li>In general, classes referenced by a JAR-class-path entry are 
		    found as though they were part of the JAR file. The JAR files
		    that appear in the JAR-class-path are searched after any earlier
		    class path entries, and before any entries that appear later 
		    in the class path.
		<p>
		<li>However, if the JAR-class-path points to a JAR file that was already
                    searched (for example, an extension, or a JAR file that was listed 
		    earlier in the class path) then that JAR file will not be searched again.
		    (This optimization improves efficiency and prevents circular searches.)
	            Such a JAR file is searched at the point that it appears, earlier 
		    in the class path.
		<p>
		<li>If a JAR file is installed as an extension in the SDK's <code>ext</code> 
		    subdirectory, then any JAR-class-path it defines is ignored. All the
		    classes required by an extension are presumed to be part of the SDK or
		    to have themselves been installed as extensions.

<H2>How Javac and JavaDoc Find Classes</H2>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>The <B>javac</B> and <B>javadoc</B> tools use class files
	in two distinct ways:

	<UL>
	<LI>Like any Java application, <B>javac</B> and <B>javadoc</B>
	must load various class files in order to run.
	<P>
	<LI>To process the source code they operate on, <B>javac</B>
	and <B>javadoc</B> must obtain information on object types
	used in the source code.
	</UL>

	<P>The class files used to resolve source code references are
	mostly the same class files used to run <B>javac</B> and
	<B>javadoc</B>. But there are some important exceptions:

	<UL>
	<LI>Both <B>javac</B> and <B>javadoc</B> often resolve
	references to classes and interfaces that having nothing to do
	with the implementation of <B>javac</B> or
	<B>javadoc</B>. Information on referenced user classes and
	interfaces may be present in the form of class files, source
	code files, or both.
	<P>
	<LI>The tools classes in <CODE>tools.jar</CODE> are only used
	to run <B>javac</B> and <B>javadoc</B>. The tools classes are
	not used to resolve source code references unless
	<CODE>tool.jar</CODE> is in the user class path.
	<P>
	<LI>A programmer may want to resolve boot class or extension
	class references using an alternative Java platform
	implementation. Both <B>javac</B> and <B>javadoc</B> support
	this with their <B>-bootclasspath</B> and <B>-extdirs</B>
	options. Use of these options does not modify the set of class
	files used to run the <B>javac</B> or <B>javadoc</B> tools
	themselves.
	</UL>

	<P>If a referenced class is defined in both a class file and
	source file, <B>javadoc</B> always uses the source file
	(javadoc never compiles source files). In the same situation
	<B>javac</B> uses class files, but automatically recompiles
	any class files it determines to be out of date. The rules for
	automatic recompilation are documented in the <b>javac</b>
	document for <A HREF="windows/javac.html">Windows</A> or <A
	HREF="solaris/javac.html">Solaris</A>.</P>

	<P>By default, <B>javac</B> and <B>javadoc</B> search the user
	class path for both class files and source code files. If the
	<B>-sourcepath</B> option is specified, <B>javac</B> and
	<B>javadoc</B> search only the specified source file path.

<P><A NAME="loader"></A>
<H2>Class Loading and Security Policies</H2>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>To be used, a class or interface must be loaded by a class
	loader. Use of a particular class loader determines a security
	policy associated with the class loader.</P> <P>A program can
	load a class or interface by calling the <B>loadClass</B>
	method of a class loader object. But usually a program loads a
	class or interface simply by referring to it. This invokes an
	internal class loader, which can apply a security policy to
	extension and user classes. If the security policy has not
	been enabled, all classes are &quot;trusted&quot;. Even if the
	security policy is enabled, it does not apply to bootstrap
	classes, which are always &quot;trusted.&quot;</P> <P>When
	enabled, security policy is configured by system and user
	policy files. The Java 2 SDK includes a system policy file
	that grants &quot;trusted&quot; status to extension classes
	and places basic restrictions on user classes.</P>

	<P>To enable or configure the security policy, refer to <A
	HREF="../guide/security/index.html">Security Features</A>.</P>

	<P><B>Note: </B>Some security programming techniques that
	worked with the Java 1.1 platform are incompatible with the
	class loading model of the Java 2 Platform.
