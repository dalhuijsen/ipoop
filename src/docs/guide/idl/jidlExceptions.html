<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Exceptions</H1>

<HR>

<P>CORBA has two types of exceptions: standard system exceptions which are
fully specified by the OMG and user exceptions which are defined
by the individual application programmer. CORBA exceptions are a little
different from Java exception objects, but those differences are largely
handled in the mapping from IDL to Java. 

<P>Topics in this section include:

<!--*********************DIFFERENCES****************-->

<A name="differences">
<H2>Differences Between CORBA and Java Exceptions</H2></A>


<P>To specify an exception in IDL, the interface designer 
uses the <EM>raises</EM> keyword.
This is similar to the <EM>throws</EM> specification in Java. 
When you use the exception
keyword in IDL you create a user-defined exception. The standard
system exceptions need not (and cannot) be specified this way.


<!--****************SYSTEM EXCEPTIONS***************-->

<A name="systemexceptions">
<H2>System Exceptions</H2></A>

CORBA defines a set of standard system exceptions, which
are generally raised by the ORB libraries to signal systemic 
error conditions like:</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Server-side system exceptions, such as resource exhaustion 
   or activation failure.
   
   <LI>Communication system exceptions, for example, losing contact with the
   object, host down, or cannot talk to ORB daemon (orbd).
   
   <LI>Client-side system exceptions, such as invalid operand type or
   anything that occurs before a request is sent or
   after the result comes back.
</UL>

<P>All IDL operations can throw system exceptions when invoked. 
The interface designer need not specify anything to enable operations
in the interface to throw system exceptions -- the capability is automatic.
</P>

<P>This makes sense because no matter how trivial an operation's
implementation is, the potential of an operation invocation coming
from a client that is in another process, and perhaps (likely) on
another machine, means that a whole range of errors is possible.</P>

<P>Therefore, a CORBA client should always catch CORBA system
exceptions. Moreover, developers cannot rely on the Java compiler to
notify them of a system exception they should catch, because CORBA
system exceptions are descendants of <TT>java.lang.RuntimeException</TT>. 


<A name="structure">
<H3>System Exception Structure</H3></A>

<P>All CORBA system exceptions have the same structure:

<PRE>
exception &lt;SystemExceptionName&gt; { // descriptive of error
    unsigned long <A href="#minorcodes">minor</A>;          // more detail about error
    CompletionStatus <A href="#compstatus">completed</A>;   // yes, no, maybe
}
&nbsp;
</PRE>

<P>System exceptions are subtypes of <TT>java.lang.RuntimeException</TT>
through <TT>org.omg.CORBA.SystemException</TT>:

<PRE>
java.lang.Exception
 |
 +--java.lang.RuntimeException
     |
     +--org.omg.CORBA.SystemException
         |
         +--BAD_PARAM
         |
         +--//etc. 
&nbsp;
</PRE>

<A name="minorcodes">
<H3>Minor Codes</H3></A>

<P>All CORBA system exceptions have a minor code field, a number that 
provides additional information about the nature of the failure that caused
the exception. Minor code meanings are not specified by the OMG; 
each ORB vendor
specifies appropriate minor codes for that implementation. 
For the meaning of minor codes thrown by the Java&nbsp; ORB, see 
<A href="#minorcodemeanings">Minor code meanings</A> .


<A name="compstatus">
<H3>Completion Status</H3></A>

<P>All CORBA system exceptions have a completion status field, 
indicating the status of the operation that threw the exception.
The completion codes are:

<DL>
<DT>COMPLETED_YES
<DD>The object implementation has completed processing prior to the
exception being raised.
<DT>COMPLETED_NO
<DD>The object implementation was not invoked prior to the 
exception being raised.
<DT>COMPLETED_MAYBE
<DD>The status of the invocation is unknown.
</DL>


<!--****************USER EXCEPTIONS***************-->

<A name="userexceptions">
<H2>User Exceptions</H2></A>

<P>CORBA user exceptions are subtypes of <TT>java.lang.Exception</TT>
through <TT>org.omg.CORBA.UserException</TT>:

<PRE>
java.lang.Exception
 |
 +--org.omg.CORBA.UserException
      |
      +-- Stocks.BadSymbol
      |
      +--//etc. 
</PRE>

<P>Each user-defined exception
specified in IDL results in a generated Java exception class. These
exceptions are entirely defined and implemented by the programmer


<!--*****************MINOR CODE MEANINGS********************-->


<A name="minorcodemeanings">
<H2>Minor Code Meanings</H2></A>

<P>System exceptions all have a field <I>minor</I> that allows CORBA vendors
to provide additional information about the cause of the exception. For a 
list of standard OMG minor code exceptions (OMGVMCID), refer to the OMG document at <a href=
"http://www.omg.org/docs/omg/03-01-04.txt">
http://www.omg.org/docs/omg/03-01-04.txt</a>.

  <P>Some of the most common Sun minor code exceptions are the following:
	<p><UL>
	<LI><strong>COMM_FAILURE/201</strong>.  <em>vmcid: SUN  minor code: 201</em> 
	literally means "CONNECT_FAILURE".
	This may be caused by a <code>java.net.SocketException</code>, usually one of 
	<code>BindException</code>, <code>ConnectException</code>, or
	<code>NoRouteToHostException</code>.
	
	<P>Some things to verify are:
	<P>
		<UL>
		<LI>Is a naming service running?  If not, start the ORBD naming service as described
		in the document  
		<a href="orbd.html#starting">
		Starting and Stopping ORBD</a>.
		<LI>Are the <code>-ORBInitialHost</code> and <code>-ORBInitialPort</code> values being  
		set correctly for the naming service?  If you are uncertain about what 
		the settings should be, read the
		document  
		<a href="orbd.html#starting">
		Starting and Stopping ORBD</a>.
		<LI>Are the client and server applications aware of the port number
		 (and machine name, if applicable) where the Naming Service is running?  Read
		  <a href="orbd.html#starting">
		Starting and Stopping ORBD</a> for more
		information on how to do this.
		</UL>
		<P>


	<LI><strong>COMM_FAILURE/208</strong>. <em>vmcid: SUN  minor code: 208</em> literally
	means "CONNECTION ABORT", which generally means the connection has been dropped.  <P>
	
	<LI><strong>COMM_FAILURE/209</strong>. <em>vmcid: SUN  minor code: 209</em> literally
	means "CREATE_LISTENER_FAILED": <code>Unable to create the listener thread on the 
	specific port. Either the post is taken or there was an error creating the daemon
	 thread</code>. This generally indicates
	that the port on which you are trying to run the naming service is in use by another process.
	If you are running on Solaris, you could discover whether or not something is running 
	on this port using the following terminal prompt command:<P>
	<PRE>netstat | grep <em>port_number</em></PRE>

	
	 <P>
	 <LI><strong>OBJECT_NOT_EXIST/204</strong>. <em>vmcid: SUN  minor code: 204</em>
	 literally  means "SERVANT_NOT_FOUND".
	 It is only thrown in one place: <code>corba.INSSubcontract.getINSReference</code>.
	 <P>
	 <LI><strong>MARSHAL/217</strong>.  <em>vmcid: SUN  minor code: 217</em> means that
	 your client tried to send either a <code>wchar</code> or <code>wstring</code>
	 in GIOP 1.0, which is not legal in the spec. 
	 <P>
	 <LI><strong>MARSHAL/202</strong>. <em>vmcid: SUN  minor code: 202</em> means that the
	 code is attempting to marshal an object that derives from 
	 <code>org.omg.CORBA.Object</code>, but that particular instance has never
	 been connected to an ORB.  When using the POA, you need to register the 
	 object with the POA first.  If you need more information on how to register
	 an object with the POA, refer to the   
	 <a href="POA.html">
	 POA</a> document or the 
	 <a href="GShome.html">
	 tutorial</a>.
	 <P>
	 <LI><strong>BAD_PARAM/201</strong>.  <em>vmcid: SUN  minor code: 201</em> 
	literally means "NULL_PARAM". This exception often occurs because a Java 
	<code>null</code> was given to a <code>write</code> method such as <code>write_string</code>, 
	<code>write_octet_array</code>, etc.   You cannot return a
	 Java <code>null</code>  as the result of a Java method.
	 
	 <P>
	 <LI><strong>org.omg.CORBA.INTERNAL</strong>.  <em>vmcid: SUN  minor code: 208</em> 
	 means <code>Unable to determine local hostname using 
	 InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName()</code>.
	 
	 <P>The ORB 
	 uses <code>InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName()</code> to create a 
	 reference to the name service for looking for and/or binding references.  
	 It also uses <code>InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName()</code> on the 
	 server side to create remote object references (i.e., IORs) that contain
	 the name/port of the server (rather than a dotted-decimal/port pair).
	 
	 <P>To avoid the call to <code>getHostName</code>, you can set the following
	 properties (refer to <a href="orbd.html#starting">
		Starting and Stopping ORBD</a> if you are not sure how to do this):
	 
	 <P><UL>
	 <LI>Set <code>com.sun.CORBA.ORBServerHost</code> to the DNS name or dotted-decimal
	 address of the server if the ORB is acting as a server.
	 <LI>Set <code>com.sun.CORBA.ORBInitialHost</code> to the DNS name or dotted-decimal
	 address of the name server.
	 </UL>
	 <P>
	 <STRONG>NOTE: These properties are proprietary and are subject to deletion or 
	 change.</STRONG>
