<h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>The intranet is a more controlled environment than the internet, and you can 
  decide whether you want to deploy your applets via the <code>APPLET</code>, 
  <code>OBJECT</code>, or <code>EMBED</code> tags. This chapter deals with deployment 
  using the <code>OBJECT</code> or <code>EMBED</code> tags.</p>
<p>Java Plug-in can be deployed in an intranet environment so that users can download 
  and install it without leaving the firewall. Deployment details for Internet 
  Explorer and Netscape Navigator are described below.</p>

      <p>You need to understand the Java Plug-in tagging structure to understand 
        the discussion below. The tagging structure is explained in <a href="using_tags.html">Using 
        OBJECT, EMBED and APPLET Tags in Java Plug-in</a>.)</p>

<h2><a name="IE"></a>Deploying Java Plug-in with Internet Explorer (IE)</h2>
<p>To deploy Java Plug-in in intranet environments with IE, you need to download 
  and store the Java Plug-in binary file on a web server. Then you need to modify 
  the <tt>codebase</tt> attribute inside the <tt>&lt;OBJECT&gt;</tt> tag in the 
  HTML file to point to the binary. For example, if you want to use the Java Plug-in 
  binary file in <code>http://my_company.com/plugin/</code>, then you should specify 
  the <tt>codebase</tt> attribute as </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>&quot;http://my_company.com/plugin/jre-1_4-win.exe#Version=1,4,0,0&quot;</code> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>(For Internet deployment the above might use a <code>.cab</code> file rather 
  than <code>.exe</code>. The <code>.cab</code> file points to an <code>.exe</code> 
  and provides a download progress bar.) </p>
<p>Note the version number in the above URL. For Java Plug-in 1.4, the version 
  number is <code>1,4,0,0</code>. This version number changes for each release, 
  and you must change the version number inside the <tt>&lt;OBJECT&gt;</tt> tag 
  if you want to specify the newest release of Java Plug-in. </p>
<p>The file <code>jre-1_4-win.exe#Version=1,4,0,0</code> is the same binary that 
  can be download directly from the Java Software web site. It is digitally signed 
  with a VeriSign digital signature signed by Sun Microsystems, Inc. If you are 
  using the Java Plug-in HTML Converter, you can simply change the conversion 
  template file to specify the latest Plug-in version (the <tt>CabFileLocation</tt> 
  variable) before the conversion. For information about modifying the conversion 
  template, consult the README file in the Java Plug-in HTML Converter. Note that 
  <code>CabFileLocation</code> can be the location of the <code>.cab</code> file 
  or the <code>.exe</code>.</p>
<p> Once you have implemented these changes, when a machine that does not have 
  Java Plug-in installed browses an HTML page with IE, IE will look into your 
  predefined location (<tt>http://my_company.com/plugin</tt> in the example) and 
  download Java Plug-in. Notice that there is no need to download Java Plug-in 
  over the firewall if the web server is inside the intranet.

    <td>
      <h3 align="left"><u>Note: Recommendations</u></h3>
      <p>The following is recommeded for long-term reliability:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For the <code>codebase</code> attribute in the <code>OBJECT</code> 
          tag, it is recommended that you use the <code>.exe</code> version, rather 
          than the <code>.cab</code> version, on <code>java.sun.com</code>. That 
          <code>.cab</code> version on <code>java.sun.com</code> may point to 
          an updated version that you do not want to use for your deployment.</li>
        <li>It is also recommend that you create your own download site for the 
          versions you need so that you do not rely on <code>java.sun.com</code>. 
          Downloads on <code>java.sun.com</code> frequently change.</li>
      </ul>

<h2><a name="Nav"></a>Deploying Java Plug-in with Navigator </h2>
<p>For Netscape 6 you must use the APPLET tag.</p>
<p>To deploy Java Plug-in in intranet environments with Navigator 4, you need 
  to download and store the Java Plug-in binary file on one of your web servers. 
  Then you need to set up a Java Plug-in Download page and modify the <tt>pluginspage</tt> 
  attribute in the EMBED tag to refer to this page. For example, if you have set 
  up the Java Plug-in Download page at &quot;<tt>http://my_company.com/plugin/</tt>&quot; 
  and the page is called <tt>plugin-install.html</tt>, you can specify the <tt>pluginspage</tt> 
  as &quot;<tt>http://my_company.com/plugin/plugin-install.html</tt>&quot;. The Download 
  page should have options to download different versions of Java Plug-in, such 
  as for Windows and Solaris.</p>
<p>If you are using the Java Plug-in HTML Converter, you can simply change the 
  conversion template file to specify your download page (the <tt>NSFileLocation</tt> 
  variable) before the conversion. For information about modifying the conversion 
  template, see <a href="html_converter_more.html#details">Details About Templates</a> 
  in the chapter called <a href="html_converter_more.html">More About HTML Converter</a> 
  or consult the Help file in the HTML Converter itself (Help&gt;Help). </p>
<p> Once you have implemented these changes, when a machine that does not have 
  Java Plug-in installed browses an HTML page with Navigator, users will see a 
  missing-plugin icon on the HTML page. When the user clicks on this picture, 
  Navigator directs the user to your predefined Java Plug-in Download Page <code>(http://my_company.com/plugin/plugin-install.html</code> 
  in this example). Notice that there is no need to download Java Plug-in over 
  the firewall if the web server is inside the intranet. 
<h2>Deploying Java Plug-in with Unix/Linux with Navigator</h2>
<p>There are two ways that Java Plug-in might be installed in the Intranet environment 
  with Unix or Linux:
<ul>
  <li>It might be installed on a per-user-account basis on individual machines, 
    as it is installed in the Window environment.</li>
  <li>It might be installed by a system administrator on a shared NSF drive for 
    shared installation.</li>
</ul>
<p>In either case, for Netscape 4 the environmental variable NPX_PLUGIN_PATH must 
  be set to point to the Java Plug-in. When Java Plug-in is installed on the local 
  machine, then the user needs to set this variable to point to the Java Plug-in 
  in the JRE on the local machine. For a shared installation, the system administrator 
  needs to determine the shared location of the Java Plug-in in the shared JRE 
  on the NSF drive and set the user profile for every machine to point to this 
  via NPX_PLUGIN_PATH.</p>
