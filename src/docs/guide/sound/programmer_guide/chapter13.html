<h3> <a name="what"></a>What Are Services? </h3>
<p> Services are units of sound-handling functionality that are automatically 
  available when an application program makes use of an implementation of the 
  Java<font size="-1"><sup>TM</sup></font> Sound API. They consist of objects 
  that do the work of reading, writing, mixing, processing, and converting audio 
  and MIDI data. An implementation of the Java Sound API generally supplies a 
  basic set of services, but mechanisms are also included in the API to support 
  the development of new sound services by third-party developers (or by the vendor 
  of the implementation itself). These new services can be "plugged into" an existing 
  installed implementation to expand its functionality without requiring a new 
  release. In the Java Sound API architecture, third-party services are integrated 
  into the system in such a way that an application program's interface to them 
  is the same as the interface to the "built-in" services. In some cases, application 
  developers who use the<code> javax.sound.sampled</code> and <code>javax.sound.midi</code> 
  packages might not even be aware that they are employing third-party services. 
</p>
<p> Examples of potential third-party, sampled-audio services include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Sound file readers and writers 
  <li>Converters that translate between different audio data formats 
  <li>New audio mixers and input/output devices, whether implemented purely in 
    software, or in hardware with a software interface 
</ul>
Third-party MIDI services might consist of:
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>MIDI file readers and writers 
  <li>Readers for various types of soundbank files (which are often specific to 
    particular synthesizers) 
  <li>MIDI-controlled sound synthesizers, sequencers, and I/O ports, whether implemented purely in software, or in hardware with a software interface
</ul>
<h3> <a name="how"></a>How Services Work</h3>
<p> The<code> javax.sound.sampled</code> and<code> javax.sound.midi</code> packages 
  provide functionality to application developers who wish to include sound services 
  in their application programs. These packages are for <em>consumers</em> of 
  sound services, providing interfaces to get information about, control, and 
  access audio and MIDI services. In addition, the Java Sound API also supplies 
  two packages that define abstract classes to be used by <em>providers</em> of 
  sound services: the <code>javax.sound.sampled.spi</code> and <code>javax.sound.midi.spi</code> 
  packages. </p>
<p> Developers of new sound services implement concrete subclasses of the appropriate 
  classes in the SPI packages. These subclasses, along with any additional classes 
  required to support the new service, are placed in a Java<font size="-1"><sup>TM</sup></font> 
  Archive (JAR) archive file with a description of the included service or services. 
  When this JAR file is installed in the user's <code>CLASSPATH</code>, the runtime 
  system automatically makes the new service available, extending the functionality 
  of the Java<font size="-1"><sup>TM</sup></font> platform's runtime system. </p>
<p> Once the new service is installed, it can be accessed just like any previously 
  installed service. Consumers of services can get information about the new service, 
  or obtain instances of the new service class itself, by invoking methods of 
  the <code>AudioSystem</code> and <code>MidiSystem</code> classes (in the <code>javax.sound.sampled</code> 
  and <code>javax.sound.midi</code> packages, respectively) to return information 
  about the new services, or to return instances of new or existing service classes 
  themselves. Application programs need not&#151;and should not&#151;reference 
  the classes in the SPI packages (and their subclasses) directly to make use 
  of the installed services. </p>
<p> For example, suppose a hypothetical service provider called Acme Software, 
  Inc. is interested in supplying a package that allows application programs to 
  read a new format of sound file (but one whose audio data is in a standard data 
  format). The SPI class <code>AudioFileReader</code> can be subclassed into a 
  class called, say, <code>AcmeAudioFileReader</code>. In the new subclass, Acme 
  would supply implementations of all the methods defined in <code>AudioFileReader</code>; 
  in this case there are only two methods (with argument variants), <code>getAudioFileFormat</code> 
  and <code>getAudioInputStream</code>. Then when an application program attempted 
  to read a sound file that happened to be in Acme's file format, it would invoke 
  methods of the <code>AudioSystem</code> class in <code>javax.sound.sampled</code> 
  to access the file and information about it. The methods <code>AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream</code> 
  and <code>AudioSystem.getAudioFileFormat</code> provide a standard API to read 
  audio streams; with the <code>AcmeAudioFileReader</code> class installed, this 
  interface is extended to support the new file type transparently. Application 
  developers don't need direct access to the newly registered SPI classes: the 
  <code>AudioSystem</code> object methods pass the query on to the installed <code>AcmeAudioFileReader</code> 
  class. </p>
<p> What's the point of having these "factory" classes? Why not permit the application 
  developer to get access directly to newly provided services? That is a possible 
  approach, but having all management and instantiation of services pass through 
  gatekeeper system objects shields the application developer from having to know 
  anything about the identity of installed services. Application developers just 
  use services of value to them, perhaps without even realizing it. At the same 
  time this architecture permits service providers to effectively manage the available 
  resources in their packages. </p>
<p> Often the use of new sound services is transparent to the application program. 
  For example, imagine a situation where an application developer wants to read 
  in a stream of audio from a file. Assuming that <code>thePathName</code> identifies 
  an audio input file, the program does this: </p>
<pre>    File theInFile = new File(thePathName);
    AudioInputStream theInStream = AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(theInFile); 
</pre>
Behind the scenes, the <code>AudioSystem</code> determines what installed service 
can read the file and asks it to supply the audio data as an <code>AudioInputStream</code> 
object. The developer might not know or even care that the input audio file is 
in some new file format (such as Acme's), supported by installed third-party services. 
The program's first contact with the stream is through the <code>AudioSystem</code> 
object, and all its subsequent access to the stream and its properties are through 
the methods of <code>AudioInputStream</code>. Both of these are standard objects 
in the <code>javax.sound.sampled</code> API; the special handling that the new 
file format may require is completely hidden. 
<p></p>
<h3> <a name="how_providers"></a>How Providers Prepare New Services</h3>
<p> Service providers supply their new services in specially formatted JAR files, 
  which are to be installed in a directory on the user's system where the Java 
  runtime will find them. JAR files are archive files, each containing sets of 
  files that might be organized in hierarchical directory structures within the 
  archive. Details about the preparation of the class files that go into these 
  archives are discussed in Chapters 14 and 15, which describe the specifics of 
  the audio and MIDI SPI packages; here we'll just give an overview of the process 
  of JAR file creation. </p>
<p> The JAR file for a new service or services should contain a class file for 
  each service supported in the JAR file. Following the Java platform's convention, 
  each class file has the name of the newly defined class, which is a concrete 
  subclass of one of the abstract service provider classes. The JAR file also 
  must include any supporting classes required by the new service implementation. 
  So that the new service or services can be located by the runtime system's service 
  provider mechanism, the JAR file must also contain special files (described 
  below) that map the SPI class names to the new subclasses being defined. </p>
<p> To continue from our example above, say Acme Software, Inc. is distributing 
  a package of new sampled-audio services. Let's suppose this package consists 
  of two new services: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The <code>AcmeAudioFileReader</code> class, which was mentioned above, and 
    which is a subclass of <code>AudioFileReader</code> 
  <li>A subclass of <code>AudioFileWriter</code> called <code>AcmeAudioFileWriter</code>, 
    which will write sound files in Acme's new format 
</ul>
Starting from an arbitrary directory&#151;let's call it <code>/devel</code>&#151;where 
we want to do the build, we create subdirectories and put the new class files 
in them, organized in such a manner as to give the desired pathname by which the 
new classes will be referenced: 
<p></p>
<pre>    com/acme/AcmeAudioFileReader.class
    com/acme/AcmeAudioFileWriter.class
</pre>
In addition, for each new SPI class being subclassed, we create a mapping file 
in a specially named directory <code>META-INF/services</code>. The name of the 
file is the name of the SPI class being subclassed, and the file contains the 
names of the new subclasses of that SPI abstract class. 
<p></p>
<p> We create the file 
<blockquote>
  <p><code>META-INF/services/javax.sound.sampled.spi.AudioFileReader</code>, which 
    consists of </p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>
    # Providers of sound file-reading services 
    # (a comment line begins with a pound sign)
    com.acme.AcmeAudioFileReader
</pre>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>and also the file </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>META-INF/services/javax.sound.sampled.spi.AudioFileWriter, </code>which 
    consists of </p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>   # Providers of sound file-writing services 
    com.acme.AcmeAudioFileWriter
</pre>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we run <code>jar</code> from any directory with the command line: </p>
<blockquote><pre>jar cvf acme.jar -C /devel .
</pre></blockquote>
The <code>-C </code>option causes <code>jar</code> to switch to the <code>/devel </code>directory, instead of using the directory in which the command is executed. The final period argument instructs <code>jar</code> to archive all the contents of that directory (namely, <code>/devel</code>), but not the<code> </code>directory itself.
<p></p>
<p> This run will create the file <code>acme.jar</code> with the contents: 
<blockquote>
  <pre>com/acme/AcmeAudioFileReader.class
com/acme/AcmeAudioFileWriter.class
META-INF/services/javax.sound.sampled.spi.AudioFileReader
META-INF/services/javax.sound.sampled.spi.AudioFileWriter
META-INF/Manifest.mf
</pre>
</blockquote>
The file <code>Manifest.mf, </code>which is generated by the <code>jar</code> utility itself, is a list of all the files contained in the archive.
<p></p>
<h3> <a name="how_users"></a>How Users Install New Services</h3>
<p> For end users (or system administrators) who wish to get access to a new service 
  through their application programs, installation is simple. They place the provided 
  JAR file in a directory in their <code>CLASSPATH.</code> Upon execution, the 
  Java runtime will find the referenced classes when needed. </p>
<p> It's not an error to install more than one provider for the same service. 
  For example, two different service providers might supply support for reading 
  the same type of sound file. In such a case, the system arbitrarily chooses 
  one of the providers. Users who care which provider is chosen should install 
  only the desired one. </p>
