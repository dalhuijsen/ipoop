   This document describes the changes made to Javadoc between versions 1.1 
   and 1.2.  It is divided into sections for three types of users: 
   (1) for writers of doc comments, (2) for developers
   wanting to write doclets (architecture and the Doclet API), and
   (3) for readers of the javadoc-generated HTML pages (content and format).
   Further details are given in the "Detailed Changes" section that follows.

<a name="docletapi"></a>
   <h3>ARCHITECTURE - DOCLET API</h3>

Javadoc now has a Doclet API to which you can write doclets. 
This is a major architectural change to Javadoc.

<blockquote> 
         You can use Javadoc doclets to customize Javadoc output. Think of
         a doclet as a plug-in for text conversion. A doclet is written
         written to the doclet API
         to specifies the content and format of the output to be
         generated by the Javadoc tool. You can write a doclet to generate
         any kind of text-file output, such as HTML, SGML, XML, RTF, and
         MIF. Sun provides a "standard" doclet for generating
         HTML-format API documentation. Doclets can also be used to
         perform special tasks not related to producing API documentation.
         For example, a diagnostic doclet could be created to check that
         all members have documentation comments.
<p>
<b>Motivation for New Architecture</b> - 
The original Javadoc (in 1.0.x and 1.1.x) takes java source files as input
and produces HTML as output.  The format of the HTML output is hard
coded in java.  The disadvantage is that developers who want to customize 
the output are out of luck, unless they have a source license and want 
to hack some very arcane code.  This means technical writers cannot make 
enhancements they might need, whether minor (such as capitalizing a word, 
changing color, adding bold, ...) or major (converting to a new format, 
such as MIF or RTF).
<p>

The requirements for the Javadoc re-architecting were:

<ul>
 <li>Separate the mechanisms used to parse and process the input source
    from the specification of the output format.
<p>

 <li>Make the output format specification pluggable.
<p>

 <li>Make the output format specification as comprehensible as possible to
    tech writers.
</ul>


New architecture: The javadoc front-end handles command line arguments
and java parsing/processing, constructing a root data structure
and passes this off to a java "doclet".  The doclet would access 
this data via an API representing packages, classes, methods, 
fields, and comments, as well as enumerations of these objects.
New doclets could be written to this API, or standard doclets 
could be subclassed to allow minor changes.
<p>

</blockquote>


<a name="newtags"></a>
   <h3>CONTENT - NEW TAGS</h3>
These tags are actually implemented in the javadoc API, 
not in the standard doclet.

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
         <b>New tag "@throws" is a synonym for "@exception"</b>.  
         This is a convenience, since "throws" is a keyword in the Java language. 

<p>

<dt>
         <b>Existing tag "@see" now accepts packages, HTML anchors and quoted strings.  
         It can also take a label.</b>
         An @see tag can refer to a package just like it can refer to a class, method or other API.
         The HTML anchor is of the form <code>&lt;a href="xxx"&gt;XXX&lt;/a&gt;</code> and
         the quoted string is of the form "xxx".  For examples, 
         see <a href="../windows/javadoc.html#classtags">Javadoc 
         Reference Page</a>.  The label is optional and is of the form:  "@see&nbsp;name&nbsp;label".
         If a label is included, it will be displayed instead of the name.
<p>

<dt>
         <b>New tag "{@link apiname label}" is for in-line links in text.</b> 
         In previous versions of Javadoc, the only way to include links to API 
         was to use the @see tag or to hard-code HTML.  This new in-line tag uses the
         same algorithm that @see uses to generate the HTML link.  The difference 
         is that it places the link in-line rather than under a "See Also" heading.
<p>

<a name="moreinfo"></a>
   <h3>CONTENT - PROVIDES MORE API INFORMATION AND LINKS</h3>

<a name="packageleveldoc"></a>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
         <b>Add to source tree one file per package, named "package.html", 
         dedicated to doc comments.</b>  The first sentence of each 
         package description is the summary. Javadoc picks up everything 
         between &lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt; and add it to the 
         package summary page "package-summary.html" (which
         also contains a table of its classes and interfaces).  
         Javadoc copies the first sentence of this to the overview page
         "overview.html".
         Therefore, you should not put a title or any other text 
         between &lt;body&gt; and the first sentence.
<p>
         Outline for package-level comments:
         <ul>
           <li> Introduction
           <li> Package Specification
           <li> Related Documentation
         </ul>
<p>
         For more information, see <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/index.html#packagecomments">Package Level Comments</a>.
<dd>
         <b>Old Behavior:</b> Javadoc 1.1 has no mechanism for including comments specific to a
         particular package.


<a name="firstsentenceofpackage"></a>
<blockquote>
            <b>NOTE</b> - The above feature requires writers to follow a 
            new Javadoc rule:  The first sentence of each package
            description should be a summary statement.
</blockquote>



<a name="systemleveldoc"></a>
<p>
<dt>
         <b>Add a single system-wide document "overview.html" for the set
         of packages.</b>  Include in it any comments that apply to
         the all the packages being documented.  For example, you might
         document the following assumption on this page:
         "NullPointerException is thrown wherever null is passed in, 
         except as noted."
<p>
         This file belongs in your source tree and can be any filename you specify.  
         By convention, we use the name "overview.html".  Specify this filename 
         with the -overview option on the command line when running Javadoc and 
         the file's contents (between the &lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt; tags) 
         is inserted into the initial page that appears in the right-hand frame,
         named <b>overview-summary.html</b> (which was called 
         packages.html in Beta3 and earlier versions).   
<dd>
         <b>Old Behavior:</b> Javadoc 1.1 has no mechanism for including comments that apply to 
         all packages.


<p>
<dt>
         <b>Javadoc picks up the first sentence one-line summary for each 
         package from package.html and puts it in packages.html.</b>
         This provides a brief summary of each packages in the list of 
         all packages. 
<dd>
         <b>Old Behavior:</b> Javadoc 1.1 has no such summary list.
 

<a name="firstsentenceofclass"></a>
<p>
<dt>
         <b>Pick up the first sentence of each class description and
         include it in the class summary at package-&lt;class&gt;.html</b>
         This provides a brief summary of all classes for a given package.
<dd>
         <b>Old Behavior:</b> Javadoc 1.1 has no such summary list.

<blockquote>
            <b>NOTE</b> - The above feature requires writers to follow a 
            new Javadoc rule:  The first sentence of each class
            description should be a summary statement.
</blockquote>


<p>
<dt>
         <b>Add inherited API to method and field summaries on class 
         and interface pages.</b>
<dd>
         <b>Old Behavior:</b> In Javadoc 1.1, the inherited members for a given class do 
         not appear on the class page, necessitating following links
         to discover them.

<p>
<dt>
         <b>Include return type and keywords "static", "protected" and 
         "abstract" in the signature in the method summary</b>, since 
         they are needed by someone calling a method.
         Do not include public, transient, volatile, or final;
         those appear in the detail section further down the page. 
         Include data type of fields. 
<dd>
         <b>Old Behavior:</b> In Javadoc 1.1, method summaries don't indicate the return type.  
         Field summaries don't indicate the field type. 

         
<p>
<dt>
         <b>Add "Specified by" for members that implement an interface.</b> 
<dd>
         <b>Old Behavior:</b> In Javadoc 1.1, members of a class that implement an interface
         make no such mention.


<p>
<dt>
         <b>Add the list of subclasses at the top of the class page.</b>  
         Also add the subinterfaces and implementing classes at the top of the interface pages.
<dd>
         <b>Old Behavior:</b> Javadoc 1.1 does not list subclasses on a class page.


<p>
<dt>
         <b>Copy the description automatically from the method in an interface to
         its implementing subclass only when the implementing method contains 
         no text.</b>  Include a boilerplate statement that says that the text is 
         copied from the interface.  The reason for doing this, is that
         when implementing an interface, the method descriptions are often 
         identical for both the interface and the class.  Copying the descriptions
         manually seems like needless work that is difficult to maintain.
<dd>
         <b>Old Behavior:</b> Javadoc 1.1 does not copy method descriptions from an interface. 

<p>
<dt>
         <b>Add a tree view for each package.</b>  When you are viewing a package 
         or class, the "Tree" link goes to that view, which then has a link
         to the tree for all packages.  
<dd>
         <b>Old Behavior:</b> Javadoc 1.1 has no tree view (class hierarchy) of single packages.  
         The only tree view is of all packages, which, for the JDK, is overwhelming.

<p>
<dt>
         <b>Introduce -link option for linking to external Javadoc-generated documents.</b>
         Default is to not link to external documentation.
         When someone generates docs, the -link option generates links to documentation 
         for any API referenced by the API being documented.  The links can be local or
         remote (on the Internet).
<dd>
         <b>Old Behavior:</b> Javadoc 1.1 makes no links to documentation outside what is being
         generated.

<p>
<dt>
         <b>Submit bugs against default constructors that should
         not be documented by Javadoc.</b> We should either 
         deprecate them or remove them as bugs.
<br>
         (Does not affect Javadoc)
<dd>
         <b>Old Behavior:</b> Javadoc includes all default constructors, whether or not
         an application developer would ever call them.  When it documents
         default constructors, it leaves their descriptions blank.

<p>
<dt>
         <b>Add a deprecated summary page listing all deprecated API.</b>  
         (Eventually we will add links to the replacement API.)
<dd>
         <b>Old Behavior:</b> Javadoc 1.1 does not generate a list of deprecated API.

<p>
<dt>
         <b>Mark classes that are deprecated.</b>
<dd>
         <b>Old Behavior:</b> In Javadoc 1.1, deprecated classes are not marked as such in 
         the class list for a given package.

<p>
<dt>
         <b>Remove "synchronized" and "native" from signatures.</b>
	 Javadoc generates an API specification.  These two keywords
         do not belong in the signatures of a specification, because
         they are implementation-specific.  The keyword "native" 
         does not need to be documented.  The keyword
         "synchronized" indicates thread-safe behavior that should
         instead be described in the method descriptions. 
         A thread-safe method itself might not use the "synchronized"
         keyword but might call private methods that are.  
<dd>
         <b>Old Behavior:</b> Javadoc 1.1 includes the keywords "synchronized" and "native". 

<a name="docfiles"></a>
<p>
<dt>
         <b>Copy "doc-files" directory (one per package) for holding 
         images and examples.</b>
         Javadoc looks for a directory named "doc-files" in each package 
         directory of the source tree and copies that directory and its 
         contents to the destination.  The files in "doc-files" are merely 
         copied to the destination and <i>not processed</i> by Javadoc.
         This means these files cannot contain the standard navigation bar,
         header or footer, or be included in the index or tree.
         This directory can contain arbitrary files referenced by doc
         comments.  Examples:  images, HTML files, text files, 
         example source code, HTML tables shared by more than one class.
<p>
         Example:  To include a reference to the image file "Button-1.gif"
         within the description for the java.awt.Button class:
<ul type=disc>
         <li>In the source tree, create a directory named "doc-files" in the "java/awt/" directory.
         <li>Put the "Button-1.gif" file in the "doc-files" directory.
         <li>Add an &lt;img&gt; tag to your doc comment for the Button class:
<pre>
   /**
    * &lt;img src="doc-files/Button-1.gif"&gt;
    */
</pre>
</ul>
         Java Software has adopted the naming convention starting with "-1" and incrementing
         for subsequent images.  For more details, see
         <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/index.html#images">Including 
         Images</a>.
<dd>
         <b>Old Behavior:</b> In Javadoc 1.1, running Javadoc generates files with broken links 
         because images are not copied to the destination. (In the JDK, 
         these images are currently mostly screen shots of AWT and 
         Swing components.)

<a name="customtitle"></a>
   <h3>CONTENT - CUSTOMIZABLE TITLE/HEADER/FOOTER</h3>

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
         <b>Add the -title option to include a title to first page 
         "packages.html".</b>  Example title: "Java Platform 1.2 Core API".
<dd>
         <b>Old Behavior:</b> Javadoc 1.1 has no formal way to add a title to the 
         generated document.

<p>
<dt>
         <b>Add -header, -footer, -bottom options for header/footer/bottom
         on every page.</b>
         This enables you to put the version number of the API (such as "Java 1.2 Beta 4") 
         on every page so that when you print out a page, you have a record of the 
         version it came from.  The "bottom" feature lets you add a copyright 
         notice or feedback email link at the bottom of each page.
<dd>
         <b>Old Behavior:</b> In Javadoc 1.1, the version number by default does not appear 
         on any page.

   <h3>CONTENT - NO LINKS TO SOURCE FILES</h3>

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
         For internal development, having direct links from each 
	 Javadoc-generated class page to its source code would be handy. 

         <i>However, we have decided not to include links in the Java API 
          documentation to the Java source code when we generate and 
          publish our API documentation.  Hence it becamse a low priority
          to put that feature into the standard doclet.  However, 
          we have made available separately a
          <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/faq/index.html#sourcedoclet">doclet

         <b>Old Behavior:</b> Javadoc 1.1 requires GIF images for bullets and headers.  
         These are not necessary, they slow down the display, and they

   <h3>FORMAT - STYLE SHEET</h3>

         <b>Add HTML style sheets for control of colors, fonts and positioning.</b>
         Style sheets are a standardized way of setting the colors, fonts 
         and positioning of text on web pages at runtime.  To modify the colors 
         of the table cells or the font sizes in the left-hand frames,
         modify the file <code>stylesheet.css</code> that is generated by javadoc.
         There is also a -stylesheetfile option when running javadoc for specifying 
         your own style sheet.  
<p>
         For example, you can change the background cell color of the headings from
         dark blue to white by editing the file <code>stylesheet.css</code> as follows.
<p>
From:
<pre>
   #TableHeadingColor     { background: #CCCCFF } /* Dark mauve */
</pre>

To:
<pre>
   #TableHeadingColor     { background: #FFFFFF } /* Dark mauve */
</pre>

         It requires users to backtrace.

<p>

         It would be nice to have a list of just classes and interfaces.

<dd>
         <b>Old Behavior:</b> In Javadoc 1.1, the standard navigation bar along the top changes

<dd>
         <b>Old Behavior:</b> Javadoc 1.1 has a link in packages.html called "API Users Guide".

   <h3>FORMAT - WEB PAGES</h3>

<dt>
         <b>Change the summaries to tables with borders and cell background color.</b>
         This better distinguishes between summary and detail portions of 
         class files.
<br>
<dd>
         <b>Old Behavior:</b> In Javadoc 1.1, both the summary and detail portions both look quite 
         similar, it's not obvious when scrolling down the page which section
         you are in.
 

<p>
<dt>
         <b>Keep "Index" as the name of the alphabetized list of API at the end
         of the document.</b>  Rename top portion of each package page from

         class page rename "Method Index" to "Method Summary", "Constructor
         Index" to "Constructor Summary", and "Field Index" to "Field Summary".  
<dd>
         <b>Old Behavior:</b> In Javadoc 1.1, the word "index" is used to identify both summaries at 
         the top of class pages, and the alphabetic book-type list
         containing all the API.  This is needlessly confusing.

   <h3>FORMAT - HIERARCHICAL DESTINATION FILE STRUCTURE</h3>

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
         <b>Add hierarchical destination directories that replicates the source code
         tree of one directory per subpackage.</b> Flat structure will no longer 
         be supported.   This has the effect of reducing the number of files 
         in a directory by distributing them by package.  A side effect is to 
         reduce length of filenames, since package names will 
         be directory names rather than part of the filename.
         This will make it easier for third parties to generate 
         shorter names (for example, 31-character names for the Macintosh)
         that retain some meaning.
<p>
         For example, 
         <code>java.awt.Button.html</code> will now be <code>\java\awt\Button.html</code>
         Given all the 1.2 changes, the destination file structure for
         running Javadoc on the java.applet package would now look like
         <a href="../solaris/javadoc.html#filestructure">file structure</a>.
<p>

<dd>
         <b>Old Behavior:</b> Javadoc 1.1 uses a flat structure, where all 
         HTML files sit in a single directory.

   <h3>INCOMPATIBILITIES</h3>

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
         <b>Possible incompatibilities between 1.1 and 1.2 doc comments</b>
         We have been careful to write Javadoc 1.2 to be compatible with documentation
         comments written for previous versions of Javadoc.  However, there may be a few
         cases where old documentation comments may not "work" the same when compiled with 
         Javadoc 1.2.
<p>

<ul type="disc">
     <li>Many filenames have changed.  The most important change is that 
         the initial page of the generated documentation is now index.html 
         (which sets up HTML frames) instead of packages.html.  If you want to avoid
         frames, the initial page to load is overview-summary.html (which replaces
         packages.html in 1.1).
<p>

     <li>In the text of comments, writers might have 
         <i>hard-coded</i> in-line links to API names.  Because javadoc now generates 
         hierarchical directories, those links would now be broken.  The new 
         <code>{@link}</code> tag enables proper in-line links.

<dd>
         <b>Old Behavior:</b> - The Javadoc 1.1 format is important for those who has built
         parsers that operate on and rely on that HTML output. 

<p>
<dt>
         <b>[Future] Implement a MIF doclet.</b>
         This will add the ability to generate MIF output, for importing
         into FrameMaker.

         Javadoc-generated document.</b>
         Would be useful to save the intermediate format from each
         Javadoc run and allow merging of those intermediate formats 
         into a complete document, with fully correct index, tree, class
         hierarchy, subclasses list, etc. 
<br>
