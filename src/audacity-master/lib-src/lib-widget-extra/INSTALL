This file contains extra notes on compiling and installing lib-widget-extra on
*nix platforms using the Autotools build system.

Additional macros needed by the configure script can be found in the m4
directory. Thus if you run aclocal manually, you need to do so as 
$ aclocal -I m4
If you use autoreconf, then you can ignore this because it reads the relevant
line from configure.in which tells it to include the content of the m4
directory.
