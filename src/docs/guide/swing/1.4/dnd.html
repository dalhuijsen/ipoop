<h1 align=center>Swing Data Transfer</h1>

<p>
For the Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> 2 Platform,
Standard Edition, v 1.4 release,
Swing has added support for data transfer between
applications. A drag and drop operation is a data
transfer request that has been specified by a gesture
with a graphical pointing device. In the case of
copy/paste, data transfer is often initiated with the keyboard. 
The ability to transfer data takes two forms:
<ul>
<li>Drag and drop (DnD) support
<li>Clipboard transfer via cut/copy/paste
</ul>
When adding data transfer support to Swing, the goal
was to make it easy for developers using Swing components
to add clipboard transfer as well as drag and drop to an
application.
Previous AWT support for drag and drop provided a great
deal of flexibility, but also a fair amount of complexity,
to implement.  Also, AWT support for clipboard transfer
had not been integrated into Swing in a natural way.
For this release, data transfer support
has been implemented so that the developer may take advantage of
these powerful features with minimal effort.

<p>
Because the state of each Swing component is independent
of the definition of the data model, it was easy
to implement a mechanism for moving the
data between components without worrying about the details of
the data itself.  The data transfer amounts to 
transferring part of one model to another model.
(In the case of cut/copy/paste, the data is transferred
between the model and the clipboard.)
To support data transfer, we:
<ul>
<li>
Added a small amount of API to enable data transfer with a
few method calls.
<li>
Made it possible to disable the Swing DnD implementation so
that the user can use the support provided by AWT to customize
any special behavior.
<li>
Implemented the necessary changes in the look and feel
implementations we provide.
</ul>

<h2><a name="DataTransferSupport">Data Transfer Support</a></h2>

<p>
The foundation of data transfer is support
for handling the transfer of data into and out of a component.
With this functionality available on the component, the mechanics
of managing a drag and drop can be provided automatically.
In addition, support for cut/copy/paste can also be provided
automatically.  The crux of this implementation is the new 
class <a href="../../../api/javax/swing/TransferHandler.html">
<code>TransferHandler</code></a>.  The
<a href="../../../api/javax/swing/JComponent.html">
<code>JComponent</code></a> property methods,
<a href="../../../api/javax/swing/JComponent.html#setTransferHandler(javax.swing.TransferHandler)">
<code>setTransferHandler</code></a> and
<a href="../../../api/javax/swing/JComponent.html#getTransferHandler()">
<code>getTransferHandler</code></a>, provide an entrypoint to the
data transfer mechanism for any component which extends
<code>JComponent</code>.

<p>
The table below details the extent of the cut, copy, paste, and
drop support for each of the components when a non-<code>null</code>
<code>TransferHandler</code> is installed.  Note that this support
is enabled by the look and feel code.  Support for dragging is
initially disabled, but may be enabled by calling
<code>setDragEnabled(true)</code> on the component.  If the
component doesn't have such a method, the drag may be enabled
by binding some kind of gesture to it.

<h3><a name="DefaultTransferHandlerSupport">Default TransferHandler
Support</a></h3>

For the components listed below, Swing installs default
implementations of <code>TransferHandler</code>.  For those
components that have default Swing support, the
<code>TransferHandler</code> is
installed by the <code>ComponentUI</code> if the value of the
<code>transferHandler</code> property is <code>null</code> or
marked by the presence of the <code>UIResource</code> interface.
The default <code>TransferHandler</code> implementation installed
by the <code>ComponentUI</code> is marked by the
<code>UIResource</code> interface, enabling developers to
override the default <code>TransferHandler</code>.
The following table shows the support provided.

<h3><a name="AddingSupport">Example of Adding Support to <code>JLabel</code></a></h3>

<p>The <a href="../../../api/javax/swing/JLabel.html">
<code>JLabel</code></a> component does not support DnD by
default.  The following code fragment creates a <code>JLabel</code>
that supports drag and drop on the "text" property (a
<code>String</code>):

<pre>
JLabel componentType = new JLabel();
componentType.setTransferHandler(new TransferHandler("text"));
MouseListener ml = new MouseAdapter() {
    public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) {
        JComponent c = (JComponent)e.getSource();
        TransferHandler th = c.getTransferHandler();
        th.exportAsDrag(c, e, TransferHandler.COPY);
    }
};
componentType.addMouseListener(ml);
</pre>

<p>We have included a small example that implements drag
and drop using a <code>JTextField</code> and a <code>JLabel</code>.
You can type a value into the text field, highlight the
text, then hold the mouse button down over the textfield and
drag a few pixels.  An icon appears under the cursor.
Release the icon over the <code>JLabel</code> and see the
text replace the "Drop Here" text.  Simultaneously with the
drop, the text is removed from the source textfield. 
The default behavior for
drag and drop is <code>MOVE</code>.  To change the behavior to
<code>COPY</code>, hold down the <code>CONTROL</code> key
while selecting the text.  On Windows, a plus sign appears
in the icon.  When the text is released on the target, it
is left intact in the source.  You can likewise drag
from the <code>JLabel</code> to the text field.
Note that <code>JLabel</code> does not have bindings for
copy/paste and is unable to get the focus that is required to support
this feature.

<p>See the <b>JLabelDragNDrop.java</b> example
<a href="JLabelDragNDrop.java">here</a>.

<p>
<h2><a name = "DragSupport">Drag Support</a></h2>

<p>
Some components, such as text fields, support selections.
For those kinds of components,
a drag operation is typically initiated by dragging an existing
selection with the mouse. A controller for this type of component
can recognize this
condition and initiate a drag.  For those components that don't
have selections, Swing can't automatically initiate the drag,
but Swing can handle the <i>mechanics</i> of the drag if
told that a drag attempt has been initiated as shown in the
<a href="#AddingSupport"><code>JLabel</code> example</a>.

<p>
With this level of drag support, the Swing developer can
focus on implementing a <code>TransferHandler</code> that represents
the desired transfer, and setting properties on the
Swing component.  This greatly simplifies the burden to the
Swing developer wanting to support dragging in an application.  

<p>Note that we are currently investigating providing different
visual appearances of the drag, hence the reference to
<code>Icon</code> in the API.  Stay tuned for future developments.


<h3><a name="DefaultDragSupport">Default Drag Support</a></h3>
<p>
The simplest level of support is to set a flag that indicates
the developer would like the default support enabled.
The components that offer default support for dragging
are described in the <b>Exports</b> column
of the <a href="#DefaultSupport">Components That Support
DnD</a> table; but to summarize, the classes that directly implement
<a href="../../../api/javax/swing/JFileChooser.html#setDragEnabled(boolean)">
<code>setDragEnabled</code></a> and
<a href="../../../api/javax/swing/JComponent.html#getDragEnabled()">
<code>getDragEnabled</code></a> are:
<a href="../../../api/javax/swing/JColorChooser.html">
<code>JColorChooser</code></a>, 
<a href="../../../api/javax/swing/JFileChooser.html"><code>JFileChooser</code></a>,
<a href="../../../api/javax/swing/JList.html"><code>JList</code></a>,
<a href="../../../api/javax/swing/JTable.html"><code>JTable</code></a>,
<a href="../../../api/javax/swing/JTree.html"><code>JTree</code></a>, and
<a href="../../../api/javax/swing/text/JTextComponent.html">
<code>JTextComponent</code></a>.
The drag gesture is defined as the
press of the first mouse button over a selection and dragging
a few pixels.  Setting the <code>dragEnabled</code> property
to <code>true</code> therefore has a subtle effect on mouse behavior.

<p>
When dragging is enabled on a component, the
Swing controller (in the corresponding <code>ComponentUI</code>
subclass) begins looking for a drag gesture, and if the
<code>transferHandler</code> property is <code>null</code>,
or marked by the presence of the
<a href="../../../api/javax/swing/plaf/UIResource.html">
<code>UIResource</code></a>
interface, a default implementation is installed. 
The implementation provided by Swing is marked with the
<code>UIResource</code> interface, so a developer can insert
a new <code>TransferHandler</code> by replacing
the default <code>TransferHandler</code> property with a
custom implementation.  When a drag gesture is recognized,
the <a href="../../../api/javax/swing/TransferHandler.html#exportAsDrag(javax.swing.JComponent, java.awt.event.InputEvent, int)">
<code>exportAsDrag</code></a> method is called on the
<a href="../../../api/javax/swing/TransferHandler.html">
<code>TransferHandler</code></a> which initiates the drag mechanism.
The actual transfer is handled by the
<a href="../../../api/java/awt/dnd/package-summary.html">
<code>java.awt.dnd</code></a>
mechanism, requiring no further effort from the developer.

<a name="DragSupportExtendSwing"></a>
<h3>Adding Drag Support to Subclasses of Swing Classes</h3>
<p>
The drag support provided by Swing is activated by the
<code>TransferHandler.exportAsDrag</code> method.  
This makes adding drag support as easy as:
<ol>
<li>
Installing a <code>TransferHandler</code> implementation
(so there is something to drag) by calling the 
<code>setTransferHandler</code> method.
<li>
Recognizing a drag gesture.
<li>
Calling the <code>exportAsDrag</code> method.
</ol>
<p>
Some scenarios for accomplishing this are:
<ul>
<li>
Add a <code>MouseListener</code> that watches for the
desired gesture, then call <code>getTransferHandler</code>
on the component and call the <code>exportAsDrag</code> method
when the desired gesture is found. See the
<a href="#AddingSupport">JLabel example</a>.
<li>
Reimplement the <code>processMouseEvent</code> method in a
subclass and call the <code>exportAsDrag</code> method on
the ComponentUI variable when a drag gesture is seen, otherwise execute
the superclass behavior.
<li>
In a component with a custom UI implementation, have the 
controller call <code>exportAsDrag</code> when a drag gesture
has been seen.
</ul>

<a name="TransferHandler.exportAsDrag"></a>
<h3>Operation of TransferHandler.exportAsDrag</h3>
<p>
When the <code>exportAsDrag</code> method is called on
<code>TransferHandler</code>, the drag is handled by Swing
provided functionality.  When this method is called, it is assumed
that a valid drag gesture has been recognized.  The method
performs the following steps:
<ol>
<li>
A Swing implementation of a <code>DragSource</code> and
<code>DragListener</code> is used to start the drag using the
<a href="../../../api/java/awt/datatransfer/Transferable.html">
<code>Transferable</code></a> implementation returned by
<code>createTransferable</code> as data transfer object.  
<li>
When the drop has completed, the <code>exportDone</code>
method is called on the <code>TransferHandler</code>.
For some operations, such as <code>MOVE</code>, it may
be necessary to remove the data from the source.
The default behavior for text-based components, for example,
is that a standard drag implements <code>MOVE</code> behavior
(following the drop the selected text is removed from the
source component).  The user may override this behavior by holding
down the <i>control</i> key when the text is selected for dragging.
On Windows, the drag icon visually reflects this behavior
with a small plus-sign.
</ol>

<h2><a name="DropSupport">Drop Support</a></h2>

<p>
The primary support for handling a drop is the same as for
a paste operation, the
<a href="../../../api/javax/swing/TransferHandler.html#importData(javax.swing.JComponent, java.awt.datatransfer.Transferable)">
<code>importData</code></a> method
on the <code>TransferHandler</code>. The semantics of inserting data
into a component are generally more meaningful at the
application level than the toolkit level.  Users of an application
can drop all kinds of <code>Transferable</code> implementations on
components that are completely unknown to the Swing toolkit. 
It is up to the Swing developer to
provide a <code>TransferHandler</code> with meaningful import
semantics if the default <code>TransferHandler</code> is insufficient.
<p>
A drop operation does have some differences from a paste however:
<ul>
<li>Typically a potential drop site provides feedback of
where the data would be accepted.
<li>For components with selection capabilities, the insertion
point is moved to indicate where the data would be placed.
</ul>

<h3><a name="DefaultDropSupport">Default Drop Support</a></h3>
<p>
To assist Swing developers in adding drop support to an
application, Swing provides <code>DropTarget</code>
implementations that use the <code>TransferHandler</code>
property on the Swing component.  For those components that
have a non-<code>null</code> <code>TransferHandler</code> property,
the drop target is installed by the <code>ComponentUI</code>
if the value of the <code>dropTarget</code> property is
<code>null</code> or marked by the presence of the
<code>UIResource</code> interface. 
The default <code>DropTarget</code> implementations installed
by the <code>ComponentUI</code> is marked by the
<code>UIResource</code> interface, enabling developers to
override the default <code>DropTarget</code>.

<p>
The components that provide a complete drop implementation
by default are indicated in the
<b>Imports</b> column of the
<a href="#DefaultSupport">Components That Support DnD</a> table.
There are four components that provide only some support for drop.
<code>JFileChooser</code>,
<code>JList</code>, <code>JTable</code>, and <code>JTree</code>
by default have an installed <code>DropTarget</code> that
indicates a potential insertion point.  However, to fully support imports
of data the developer must write and install a
custom <code>TransferHandler</code>.

<a name="DropSupportExtendSwing"></a>
<h3>Using the Drop Support in Subclasses of Swing Classes</h3>
<p>
A well behaved DropTarget implementation uses the 
<code>transferHandler</code> property on <code>JComponent</code>
to perform the drop.  The Swing developer automatically
gets a simple <code>DropTarget</code> implementation that links
the drop to the <code>TransferHandler</code> when the 
<code>transferHandler</code> property is set and the
<code>dropTarget</code> property is <code>null</code>.


<h2><a name="ClipboardTransferSupport">Clipboard Transfer Support</a></h2>

<p>
Cut, copy, and paste operations perform data transfer in a
manner that is more useful to those without a mouse, as they
are typically initiated via a keyboard gesture.  These operations
can use the same <code>TransferHandler</code> services as the
drag and drop support.  This improves the accessibility of the
data transfers, and enables Swing to provide keyboard bindings
for these operations even though Swing may not know how to actually
transfer the data to/from the clipboard.  The keyboard bindings
for clipboard transfer are dependent upon the current look and
feel that is installed.  

<h3><a name="DefaultClipboardTransfer">Default Clipboard Transfer</a></h3>
<p>
As with drag and drop, clipboard transfers are the most useful
for those components that support selections.  The 
list of components shown in the <b>Exports</b> column
of the <a href="#DefaultSupport">Components That Support DnD</a>
table have <b>cut</b>, <b>copy</b>, and <b>paste</b> actions in the
component action map, along with a LAF dependent set of keyboard
bindings in the input map of the component.  Having Swing provide
these bindings frees the developer from trying to track
the current look and feel and change the bindings.


<a name="ClipboardTransferSupportExtendSwing"></a>
<h3>Using the Clipboard Transfer Support in Subclasses of
Swing Classes</h3>
<p>
A well behaved cut, copy, and paste implementation uses
the <code>transferHandler</code> property on <code>JComponent</code>
to perform the transfer.  When the <code>transferHandler</code>
property is set on a <code>JComponent</code>, a simple
<code>Action</code> implementation that links the transfer of between a
<a href="../../../api/java/awt/datatransfer/Clipboard.html">
<code>Clipboard</code></a> and <code>TransferHandler</code>
is installed in the component's action map under the
keys <code>cut</code>, <code>copy</code>, and <code>paste</code>
if there is no action currently installed.

<h2><a name="Implementation">Implementation Details</a></h2>

<p><b>Note</b>: The following information outlines private 
implementation details and is subject to change.  We are providing this
information only to satisfy the curiosity of those who have access
to the source code and feel compelled to thump the tires and
peek under the hood.
<p>
If a <code>TransferHandler</code> is installed on a
<code>JComponent</code>, the look and feel then enables
<i>cut</i>, <i>copy</i>, and <i>paste</i>
using the following <code>TransferHandler</code> methods: 
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../api/javax/swing/TransferHandler.html#getCutAction()">
<code>getCutAction</code></a>
<li><a href="../../../api/javax/swing/TransferHandler.html#getCopyAction()">
<code>getCopyAction</code></a>
<li><a href="../../../api/javax/swing/TransferHandler.html#getPasteAction()">
<code>getPasteAction</code></a>
</ul>
If you bind some event to
<code>TransferHandler.exportAsDrag</code> you also get
<i>drag</i> support.
This plumbing is located in package-private nested classes inside of
the <code>TransferHandler</code> class.

<p>
The following package-private classes were added to the
<code>javax.swing.plaf.basic</code> package for creating
the default support:

<dl>
<dt><b><code>BasicTransferable</code></b>
<dd>The basis of the various <code>Transferable</code>
implementations.

<dt><b><code>BasicDropTargetListener</code></b>
<dd>Adds scrolling support and drop target feedback
for those components supporting selection.

<dt><b><code>BasicDragGestureRecognizer</code></b>
<dd>Supports the "select and move a few pixels" drag
gesture recognition.
</dl>

<p>
Each of the <code>ComponentUI</code> classes that support
DnD then have some additional nested classes:
<p><b><code>BasicTreeUI</code></b>:
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><b><code>TreeTransferHandler</code></b>
<dd>Default import/export support.
<dt><b><code>TreeTransferable</code></b>
<dd>The actual tree data.
<dt><b><code>TreeDragGestureRecognizer</code></b>
<dd>Tree drag gesture recognition, enabled by
    <code>JTree.setDragEnabled</code>.
<dt><b><code>TreeDropHandler</code></b>
<dd>Shows drop target location.
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b><code>BasicListUI</code></b>, <b><code>BasicTableUI</code></b>,
<b><code>BasicTextUI</code></b> all have a pattern similar to 
as <code>BasicTreeUI</code>.

<p>
<dl>
<dt><b><code>BasicFileChooserUI</code></b>
<dd>Uses the list support, but has a

    <p>To implement drag and drop, bindings were provided in the 
     <code>Action</code> class to support copying and pasting
     the data.  In order for a look and feel, or other code,
     to override these <code>Action</code>s, the UI must install
     them - <code>Action</code>s are no longer automatically installed
     by the <code>TransferHandler</code>.  The package-private methods

    <H3>Ability to Disable DropTarget</H3>
    <blockquote>
    <P> The bugtraq report that corresponds to this change is: <A
href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4485914.html">
      4485914</A>. </P>
    <p>The drag and drop implementation causes a <code>DropTarget</code>
     to be added to a <code>JComponent</code> if that component has
     a <code>TransferHandler</code> installed. 
     This may affect applications that are manually
     adding <code>DropTarget</code>s.  Therefore the System
     property <code>suppressSwingDropSupport</code> has been added. The
     <a href="../../../api/javax/swing/JComponent.html"><code>JComponent</code></a> methods
     <a href="../../../api/javax/swing/JComponent.html#setTransferHandler(javax.swing.TransferHandler)"><code>setTransferHandler(TransferHandler)</code></a> and
     <a href="../../../api/javax/swing/JComponent.html#getTransferHandler()"><code>getTransferHandler</code></a>
     can be used to enable or disable this property.

  <h3><a name=4513715>Drop Clobbers Selected Text in JTextComponent</a></h3>
  <blockquote>
  <P> The bugtraq report that corresponds to this problem is: <A
href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4513715.html">
      4513715</A>. </P>
  <p>Selecting text and then dragging and dropping that text within the
  selected region of the same text component causes the selected text
  to be clobbered and nothing to be pasted. 
  This bug is fixed in release 1.4.1.

  <h3>Occasional Errors in Restoring Caret when Exiting a Component</h3>
  <blockquote>
  <P> The bugtraq report that corresponds to this problem is: <A
href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4513720.html">
      4513720</A>. </P>
  <p>With the built-in drop support, Swing text components respond to DnD
   dragovers by setting the <code>Caret</code> to visible and using it
   to display the potential insert location.  When the drag exits the
   component, the <code>Caret</code>'s visibility is restored.  Unfortunately,
   since the <code>Caret</code> uses the same "<code>visible</code>"
   property to represent the usual meaning of visible as well as when it
   is in mid-flash, we sometimes restore the Caret's visibility
   incorrectly.

  <h3><a name=4513638>Cut/Copy/Drag Broken for JEditorPane with RTFEditorKit</a></h3>
  <blockquote>
  <P> The bugtraq report that corresponds to this problem is: <A
href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4513638.html">
      4513638</A>. </P>
  <p>When using an <code>RTFEditorKit</code> set explicitly on a
    <code>JEditorPane</code> using <code>setEditorKit</code>, or by
    setting the <code>content-type</code> to <code>text/rtf</code>, 
    cut, copy and drag no longer work.  Note that this bug, filed against
    release 1.4, is fixed in release 1.4.1.
