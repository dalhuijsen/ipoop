<br>
<br>

<p>This tutorial expands the program and policy file developed in the
<a href="GeneralAcnOnly.html">JAAS Authentication</a> tutorial 
to demonstrate the JAAS authorization component,
which ensures the authenticated caller has the access control rights 
(permissions) required to do subsequent security-sensitive operations.
Since the authorization component requires that the user
authentication first be completed, please read the
<a href="GeneralAcnOnly.html">JAAS Authentication</a>
tutorial first if you have not already done so.

<p>The rest of this tutorial consists of the following sections:

<a name="WhatIsAzn">
<H2>What is JAAS Authorization? </H2></a>

<blockquote>

<p>JAAS authorization extends the existing Java security
architecture that uses a security 
<a href = "../../PolicyFiles.html">policy </a>to specify what access
rights are granted to executing code. That architecture, introduced
in the Java 2 platform, is <i>code-centric</i>. That is, the permissions are
granted based on code characteristics: where the code is coming
from and whether it is digitally signed and if so by whom. We saw
an example of this in the <code>sampleacn.policy</code> file used in the
<a href="GeneralAcnOnly.html">JAAS Authentication</a> tutorial.
That file contains the following:

<blockquote>
<pre>
grant codebase "file:./SampleAcn.jar" {

   permission javax.security.auth.AuthPermission 
                    "createLoginContext.Sample";
};
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This grants the code in the <code>SampleAcn.jar</code> file, located in the
current directory, the specified permission. (No signer is specified, so
it doesn't matter whether the code is signed or not.)

<p>JAAS authorization augments the existing code-centric access controls
with new <i>user-centric</i> access controls. Permissions can be
granted based not just on what code is running but also on <i>who</i> 
is running it. 

<p>When an application uses JAAS authentication
to authenticate the user (or other entity such as a service), a
<a href="../../../../api/javax/security/auth/Subject.html">
Subject</a> is created as a result. The purpose of the Subject 
is to represent the authenticated user.
A Subject is comprised of a set of
<a href="../../../../api/java/security/Principal.html">
Principals</a>, where each Principal represents an identity for
that user. For example, a Subject could have a name Principal 
("Susan Smith") and a Social Security Number Principal ("987-65-4321"),
thereby distinguishing this Subject from other Subjects.

<p>Permissions can be granted in the policy to specific 
Principals. After the user has been authenticated, the application can 
associate the Subject with the current access control context. 
For each subsequent security-checked operation
(a local file access, for example), the Java runtime will
automatically determine whether the policy grants the 
required permission only to a specific Principal and if so, 
the operation will be allowed only if the Subject associated with
the access control context contains the designated Principal.

</blockquote>


<a name="InvokingAzn">
<H2>How is JAAS Authorization Performed?</H2></a>

<blockquote>

<p>To make JAAS authorization take place, 
the following is required:

<ul>

<li>The user must be authenticated, as described in the
<a href="GeneralAcnOnly.html">JAAS Authentication</a> tutorial. <p>

<li><a href="#UserPFStmts">Principal-based entries</a> must be configured 
in the security policy. <p>

<li>The Subject that is the result of authentication must be
<a href="#AssocSubject">associated with the current access control context</a>. 

</ul>


<a name="UserPFStmts">
<H3>How Do You Make Principal-Based Policy File Statements?</H3></a>

<blockquote>

<p><a href = "../../PolicyFiles.html">
Policy file</a> <code>grant</code> statements can now optionally include
one or more Principal fields. Inclusion of a Principal field
indicates that the user or other entity represented by
the specified Principal, executing the specified code,
has the designated permissions.

<p>Thus, the basic format of a <code>grant</code> statement is now

<blockquote>
<pre>
grant &lt;<i>signer(s) field</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>codeBase URL</i>&gt; 
  &lt;<i>Principal field(s)</i>&gt; {
    permission <i>perm_class_name</i> "<i>target_name</i>", "<i>action</i>";
    ....
    permission <i>perm_class_name</i> "<i>target_name</i>", "<i>action</i>";
  };
</pre>
</blockquote>

where each of the signer, codeBase and Principal fields is
optional and the order between the fields doesn't matter.

<p>A Principal field looks like the following:

<blockquote>
<pre>
Principal <i>Principal_class</i> "<i>principal_name</i>"
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>That is, it is the word "Principal" (where case doesn't matter)
followed by the (fully qualified) name of a Principal class and 
a principal name.

<p>A Principal class is a class that implements the 
<a href="../../../../api/java/security/Principal.html">
java.security.Principal</a> interface. 
All Principal objects have an associated name that can be
obtained by calling their <code>getName</code> method.
The format used for the name is dependent on each
Principal implementation.

<p>The type of Principal placed in the Subject created by the basic
authentication mechanism used by this tutorial is 
<code>SamplePrincipal</code>,
so that is what should be used as the <code><i>Principal_class</i></code> 
part of our <code>grant</code> statement's Principal designation.
User names for <code>SamplePrincipal</code>s are of the form 
"<i>name</i>", and the only user name accepted for this tutorial is
"testUser", so the <code><i>principal_name</i></code> designation 
to use in the <code>grant</code> statement is "testUser".

<p>It is possible to include more than one Principal field in a 
<code>grant</code> statement.
If multiple Principal fields are specified, then the permissions in that
<code>grant</code> statement are granted only if the Subject associated with the
current access control context contains <i>all</i> of those Principals.

<p>To grant the same set of permissions to different Principals,
create multiple <code>grant</code> statements where each lists 
the permissions and contains a single Principal field designating one of the 
Principals.

<p>The policy file for this tutorial includes one <code>grant</code>
statement with a Principal field:

<blockquote>
<pre>
grant codebase "file:./SampleAction.jar",
        Principal sample.principal.SamplePrincipal "testUser" {

   permission java.util.PropertyPermission "java.home", "read";
   permission java.util.PropertyPermission "user.home", "read";
   permission java.io.FilePermission "foo.txt", "read";
};
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This specifies that the indicated permissions are granted
to the specified principal executing the code in
<code>SampleAction.jar</code>. (Note: the SamplePrincipal 
class is in the <code>sample.principal</code> package.)

</blockquote>


<a name="AssocSubject">
<H3>How Do You Associate a Subject with an Access Control 
Context?</H3></a>

<blockquote>

<p>To create and associate a Subject with the current 
access control context, you need the following:

<ul>

<li>The user must first be authenticated, as described in
<a href="GeneralAcnOnly.html">JAAS Authentication</a>. <p>

<li>The static <code>doAs</code> method from the
Subject class must be called, passing it an authenticated
Subject and a 
<a href="../../../../api/java/security/PrivilegedAction.html">
java.security.PrivilegedAction</a> or
<a href="../../../../api/java/security/PrivilegedExceptionAction.html">
java.security.PrivilegedExceptionAction</a>. (See 
<a href="../../doprivileged.html">API for 
Privileged Blocks</a> for a comparison of PrivilegedAction and 
PrivilegedExceptionAction.) The <code>doAs</code> method 
associates the provided Subject with the current access control context
and then invokes the <code>run</code> method from the action.
The <code>run</code> method implementation contains all the code
to be executed as the specified Subject.
The action thus executes as the specified Subject.

<p>The static <code>doAsPrivileged</code> method from the Subject class may be 
called instead of the <code>doAs</code> method, as will be done for this
tutorial.  In addition to the parameters
passed to <code>doAs</code>, <code>doAsPrivileged</code> requires a third 
parameter: an AccessControlContext.  Unlike <code>doAs</code>, which associates
the provided Subject with the current access control context,
<code>doAsPrivileged</code> associates the Subject with the provided
access control context or with an empty access control context if the parameter
passed in is <code>null</code>, as is the case for this tutorial. 
See <a href="../../jaas/JAASRefGuide.html#doAsComp">
doAs vs. doAsPrivileged</a> in the JAAS Reference Guide for a comparison of 
those methods.

</ul>

<a name="AznCode">
<H2>The Authorization Tutorial Code</H2></a>

<blockquote>

<p>The code for this tutorial consists of four files:

<ul>

<li><a href = "#SampleAzn">SampleAzn.java</a> is exactly the same 
as the <code>SampleAcn.java</code> application file from the
<a href="GeneralAcnOnly.html">JAAS Authentication</a> tutorial
except for the additional code needed to call
<code>Subject.doAsPrivileged</code>. <p>

<li><a href = "#SampleAction">SampleAction.java</a>
contains the SampleAction class. This class implements 
PrivilegedAction and has a <code>run</code> method that contains all the
code we want to be executed with Principal-based authorization checks. <p>

<li><a href = "SampleLoginModule.java">SampleLoginModule.java</a> is 
the class specified by the tutorial's 
<a href="#ConfigFile">login configuration file</a> as the
class implementing the desired underlying authentication.
SampleLoginModule's user authentication consists of simply verifying
that the name and password specified by the user have specific
values. This class was also used by the
<a href="GeneralAcnOnly.html">JAAS Authentication</a> tutorial
and will not be discussed further here.<p>

<li><a href = "SamplePrincipal.java">SamplePrincipal.java</a> is 
a sample class implementing
the <a href="../../../../api/java/security/Principal.html">
java.security.Principal</a> interface. It is used by 
SampleLoginModule. This class was also used by the
JAAS Authentication tutorial and will not be discussed further here.

</ul>

<p>The <code>SampleLoginModule.java</code> and <code>SamplePrincipal.java</code> 
files were also used in the <a href="GeneralAcnOnly.html">JAAS Authentication</a> tutorial, so they are not described further here.
The other source files are described below.


<a name="SampleAzn"></a>
<H3>SampleAzn.java</H3>

<blockquote>

<p>Like SampleAcn, the <a href = "SampleAzn.java">SampleAzn</a>
class instantiates a 
LoginContext <code>lc</code> and calls its <code>login</code> method to 
perform the authentication. If successful, the authenticated Subject 
(which includes a SamplePrincipal representing the user) is 
obtained by calling the LoginContext's <code>getSubject</code> method:

<blockquote>
<pre>
Subject mySubject = lc.getSubject();
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>After providing the user some information about the Subject, such as
which Principals it has,
the <code>main</code> method then calls <code>Subject.doAsPrivileged</code>,
passing it the authenticated Subject <code>mySubject</code>, 
a PrivilegedAction (SampleAction) and a <code>null</code>
AccessControlContext, as described in the following.

<p>The SampleAction class is instantiated via the following:

<blockquote>
<pre>
PrivilegedAction action = new SampleAction();
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The call to <code>Subject.doAsPrivileged</code> is performed via:

<blockquote>
<pre>
Subject.doAsPrivileged(mySubject, action, null);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>doAsPrivileged</code> method invokes execution 
of the <code>run</code> method in the PrivilegedAction <code>action</code> 
(SampleAction) to initiate execution of the rest of the code, which 
is considered to be executed on behalf of the Subject <code>mySubject</code>.

<p>Passing <code>null</code> as the AccessControlContext (third)
argument to <code>doAsPrivileged</code> indicates
that <code>mySubject</code> should be associated with a new empty
AccessControlContext.  The result is that security checks
occurring during execution of SampleAction will only require
permissions for the SampleAction code itself (or other code it invokes),
running as <code>mySubject</code>.  
Note that the caller of <code>doAsPrivileged</code>
(and the callers on the execution stack at the time
<code>doAsPrivileged</code> was called) do not require any permissions
while the action executes.



</blockquote>


<a name="SampleAction">
<H3>SampleAction.java</H3></a>

<blockquote>

<p><a href = "SampleAction.java">SampleAction.java</a> contains the 
SampleAction class. This class implements 
<code>java.security.PrivilegedAction</code>
and has a <code>run</code> method that contains all the
code we want to be executed as the Subject <code>mySubject</code>.
For this tutorial, we will perform three operations, each of which cannot
be done unless code has been granted required permissions. We will:

<ul>

<li>Read and print the value of the <code>java.home</code> system property, <p>

<li>Read and print the value of the <code>user.home</code> system property, 
and <p>

<li>Determine whether or not a file named <code>foo.txt</code> exists in
the current directory.

</ul>

<p>Here is the code:

<blockquote>
<pre>
package sample;

import java.io.File;
import java.security.PrivilegedAction;

public class <b>SampleAction</b> implements PrivilegedAction {

  public Object <b>run</b>() {

    System.out.println("\nYour java.home property value is: "
                + System.getProperty("java.home"));

    System.out.println("\nYour user.home property value is: "
                + System.getProperty("user.home"));

    File f = new File("foo.txt");
    System.out.print("\nfoo.txt does ");
    if (!f.exists())
        System.out.print("not ");
    System.out.println("exist in the current working directory.");
    return null;
  }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>


</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<a name="ConfigFile"></a>
<a name="AznLCF">
<H2>The Login Configuration File</H2></a>

<blockquote>

<p>The login configuration file used for this tutorial can be
exactly the same as that used by the 
<a href="GeneralAcnOnly.html">JAAS Authentication</a> tutorial.
Thus we can use 
<a href = "sample_jaas.config">sample_jaas.config</a>, which contains just one
entry:

<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>Sample {
  sample.module.SampleLoginModule required debug=true;
};</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This entry is named "Sample" and that is the name that both our
tutorial applications <code>SampleAcn</code> and <code>SampleAzn</code>
use to refer to it.
The entry specifies that the LoginModule to be used to do the
user authentication is the SampleLoginModule in the 
<code>sample.module</code> package 
and that this SampleLoginModule is required to "succeed" in order for
authentication to be considered successful.
The SampleLoginModule succeeds only if the name and password supplied
by the user are the one it expects ("testUser" and "testPassword",
respectively).

<p>The SampleLoginModule also defines a "debug" option that can be
set to <code>true</code> as shown. If this option is set to <code>true,</code>
SampleLoginModule outputs extra information about the progress of 
authentication.

</blockquote>



<a name="AznPF">
<H2>The Policy File</H2></a>

<blockquote>

<p>The application for this authorization tutorial consists of two classes,
<code>SampleAzn</code> and <code>SampleAction</code>. The code in 
each class contains some security-sensitive operations and thus 
relevant permissions are required in a policy file in order for
the operations to be executed.

<p>The LoginModule used by this tutorial, <code>SampleLoginModule</code>,
also contains an operation requiring a permission.

<p>The permissions required by each of these classes are described
below, followed by a link to the full policy file.


<H3>Permissions Required by SampleAzn</H3>

<blockquote>

<p>The main method of the <code>SampleAzn</code> class does two operations for
which permissions are required. It

<ul>

<li>creates a LoginContext, and <p>

<li>calls the <code>doAsPrivileged</code> static method of the Subject class.

</ul>

<p>The LoginContext creation is exactly the same as was done in the
authentication tutorial, and it thus needs the same 
<code>javax.security.auth.AuthPermission</code> permission with target
"<code>createLoginContext.Sample</code>".

<p>In order to call the <code>doAsPrivileged</code> method of the Subject class,
you need to have a <code>javax.security.auth.AuthPermission</code> with
target "<code>doAsPrivileged</code>".

<p>Assuming the <code>SampleAzn</code> class is placed in a JAR file named
<code>SampleAzn.jar</code>, these permissions can be granted to the 
<code>SampleAzn</code> code via the following <code>grant</code> statement 
in the policy file:

<blockquote>
<pre>
grant codebase "file:./SampleAzn.jar" {
   permission javax.security.auth.AuthPermission 
                    "createLoginContext.Sample";
   permission javax.security.auth.AuthPermission "doAsPrivileged";
};
</pre>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>


<a name="SampleActionPerms"></a>
<H3>Permissions Required by SampleAction</H3>

<blockquote>

<p><p>The <code>SampleAction</code> code does three operations for
which permissions are required. It

<ul>

<li>reads the value of the "java.home" system property. <p>

<li>reads the value of the "user.home" system property. <p>

<li>checks to see whether or not a file named <code>foo.txt</code> exists
in the current directory.

</ul>

<p>The permissions required for these operations are the following:

<blockquote>
<pre>
permission java.util.PropertyPermission "java.home", "read";
permission java.util.PropertyPermission "user.home", "read";
permission java.io.FilePermission "foo.txt", "read";
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>We need to grant these permissions to the code in 
<code>SampleAction.class</code>, which we will place in a 
JAR file named <code>SampleAction.jar</code>. 
However, for this particular <code>grant</code> statement we want to
grant the permissions not just to the <i>code</i> but to a specific
user executing the code, to demonstrate how to restrict access to
a particular user. 

<p>Thus, as explained in <a href="#UserPFStmts">How Do You Make Principal-Based 
Policy File Statements?</a>,
our <code>grant</code> statement looks like the following:

<blockquote>
<pre>
grant codebase "file:./SampleAction.jar",
	Principal sample.principal.SamplePrincipal "testUser" {

   permission java.util.PropertyPermission "java.home", "read";
   permission java.util.PropertyPermission "user.home", "read";
   permission java.io.FilePermission "foo.txt", "read";
};
</pre>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>


<a name="LMPerms"></a>
<H3>Permissions Required by SampleLoginModule</H3>

<blockquote>

<p><p>The <code>SampleLoginModule</code> code does one operation for
which permissions are required. It needs 
a <code>javax.security.auth.AuthPermission</code> with target
"modifyPrincipals" in order to populate a Subject with a Principal.
The grant statement is the following:

<blockquote>
<pre>
grant codebase "file:./SampleLM.jar" {
    permission javax.security.auth.AuthPermission "modifyPrincipals";
};
</pre>

<a name="RunAzn">
<H2>Running the Authorization Tutorial Code</H2></a>

<blockquote>

<p>To execute our JAAS authorization tutorial code, all you
have to do is 

<ol>

<li>Place the following files into a directory: 
<p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href = "sample_jaas.config">sample_jaas.config</a> 
login configuration file.
<li>The <a href = "sampleazn.policy">sampleazn.policy</a> policy file.
</ul>
<p>

<li>Create a subdirectory named "sample" of that top-level directory, and
place the following into it (note the SampleAzn and
SampleAction classes are in a package named <code>sample</code>):
<p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href = "SampleAzn.java">SampleAzn.java</a> source file.
<li>The <a href = "SampleAction.java">SampleAction.java</a> source file.
</ul>
<p>

<li>Create a subdirectory of the "sample" directory and name it "module".
Place the following into it (note the SampleLoginModule class is 
in a package named <code>sample.module</code>):
<p>

<ul>
<li>the <a href = "SampleLoginModule.java">SampleLoginModule.java</a> 
source file 
</ul>
<p>

<li>Create another subdirectory of the "sample" directory and name it 
"principal". Place the following into it (note the 
SamplePrincipal class is in a package named <code>sample.principal</code>):
<p>

<ul>
<li>the <a href = "SamplePrincipal.java">SamplePrincipal.java</a> 
source file 
</ul>
<p>

<li>While in the top-level directory,
compile all the source files:

<blockquote>
<pre>
javac sample/SampleAction.java sample/SampleAzn.java 
sample/module/SampleLoginModule.java sample/principal/SamplePrincipal.java
</pre>
</blockquote>

(Type all that on one line.)
<p>

<li>Create a JAR file named <code>SampleAzn.jar</code> containing 
<code>SampleAzn.class</code> and <code>MyCallbackHandler.class</code> (Note
the sources for both these classes are in <code>SampleAzn.java</code>):

<blockquote>
<pre>
jar -cvf SampleAzn.jar sample/SampleAzn.class 
sample/MyCallbackHandler.class
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(Type all that on one line.)
<p>

<li>Create a JAR file named <code>SampleAction.jar</code> containing 
<code>SampleAction.class</code>:

<blockquote>
<pre>
jar -cvf SampleAction.jar sample/SampleAction.class
</pre>
</blockquote>

<li>Create a JAR file containing <code>SampleLoginModule.class</code>
and <code>SamplePrincipal.class</code>:

<blockquote>
<pre>
jar -cvf SampleLM.jar sample/module/SampleLoginModule.class 
sample/principal/SamplePrincipal.class
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>

<li>Execute the <code>SampleAzn</code> application, specifying <p>

<ol>

<li>by an appropriate <code>-classpath</code> clause that classes should be 
searched for in the <code>SampleAzn.jar</code>, <code>SampleAction.jar</code>,
and <code>SampleLM.jar</code> JAR files, <p>

<li>by <code>-Djava.security.manager</code> that a
security manager should be installed, <p>

<li>by <code>-Djava.security.policy==sampleazn.policy</code> that
the policy file to be used is <code>sampleazn.policy</code>, and <p>

<li>by <code>-Djava.security.auth.login.config==sample_jaas.config</code> that 
the login configuration file to be used is <code>sample_jaas.config</code>.

</ol>

<p>Below are the full commands to use for both Microsoft Windows and Unix systems.
The only difference is that on Windows systems you use semicolons to
separate classpath items, while you use colons for that purpose on
Unix systems.  

<p>Here is the full command for Windows systems:

<blockquote>
<pre>
java -classpath SampleAzn.jar;SampleAction.jar;SampleLM.jar 
 -Djava.security.manager 
 -Djava.security.policy==sampleazn.policy 
 -Djava.security.auth.login.config==sample_jaas.config sample.SampleAzn
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the full command for UNIX systems:

<blockquote>
<pre>
java -classpath SampleAzn.jar:SampleAction.jar:SampleLM.jar 
 -Djava.security.manager 
 -Djava.security.policy==sampleazn.policy 
 -Djava.security.auth.login.config==sample_jaas.config sample.SampleAzn
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Type the full command on one line. Multiple lines are used here 
for legibility. If the command is too long for your system, you may
need to place it in a .bat file (for Windows) or a .sh file
(for UNIX) and then run that file to execute the command.

<p>You will be prompted for a user name and password
(use  "testUser" and "testPassword"), and the SampleLoginModule  
specified in the login configuration file will check the
name and password. If your login is successful, you will see the 
message "Authentication succeeded!" and if not, you will see
"Authentication failed:" followed by a reason for the failure.

<p>Once authentication is successfully completed,
the rest of the program (in <code>SampleAction</code>) will be executed
on behalf of you, the user, requiring you to have been granted
appropriate permissions. The <code>sampleazn.policy</code> policy file
grants you the required permissions, so you will see a display of
the values of your <code>java.home</code> and <code>user.home</code>
system properties and a statement as to whether or not you have a file named
<code>foo.txt</code> in the current directory.
