this applet.  However, the applet you see now is an 
interactive slide show that will demonstrate what the 1.1
version of this applet would do.

This screen shows the special characters as they
appear in the 'Dialog' font for the unicode 
numbers listed in the leftmost column.  If this were
the real 1.1 applet, you would be able to dynamically 
change the unicode base number by entering a new one 
in the 'Unicode base:' text box.  You would also be 
able to change the font by selecting a new one from
the drop-down list box labeled 'Font:' as shown in
the next slide.;

This is an example of using the drop-down list box to
change the font being displayed from 'Dialo' to 
'SansSerif'.;

The special characters as they appear in the
'SansSerif' font with a unicode base of 2700.;

The special characters as they appear in the
'Serif' font with a unicode base of 2700.;
		    
The special characters as they appear in the
'Monospaced' font with a unicode base of 2700.;
