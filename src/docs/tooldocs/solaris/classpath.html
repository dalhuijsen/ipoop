<H1>Setting the class path</H1>

<H2>Synopsis</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	The class path is the path that the Java runtime environment searches 
        for classes and other resource files.  The class search path (more commonly 
        known by the shorter name, "class path") can be set using either the
	<code>-classpath</code> option when calling an SDK tool (the
	preferred method) or by setting the <CODE>CLASSPATH</CODE> environment
	variable.  The <code>-classpath</code> option is preferred because you 
        can set it individually for each application without affecting other
        applications and without other applications modifying its value.

<h2>Description</h2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>
        The class path tells the SDK tools and applications where to find 
        third-party and user-defined classes  -- that is, classes that 
        are not 
        <A HREF="../../guide/extensions/index.html">extensions</A>
	or part of the Java platform.  The class path needs to find any 
        classes you've compiled with the javac compiler -- its default
        is the current directory to conveniently enable those classes to 
        be found.
        <P>

	Java 2 SDK, the JVM and other SDK tools find classes by searching
	the Java platform (bootstrap) classes, any extension classes, 
	and the class path, in that order. (For details on the search 
	strategy, see
	<A HREF="../findingclasses.html">How Classes Are Found</A>.)
	Class libraries for most applications will want to take
	advantage of the <A HREF="../../guide/extensions/index.html">extensions
	mechanism</A>. You only need to set the class path when you
	want to load a class that's (a) not in the current
	directory or in any of its subdirectories, and (b) not in a
	location specified by the extensions mechanism. 
	</P>

	<P>
	If you are upgrading from an older version of the SDK software, your
	startup settings may include <CODE>CLASSPATH</CODE> settings that are no
	longer needed. You should remove any settings that are not
	application-specific, such as <code>classes.zip</code>. 
	Some third-party applications that use
	the Java Virtual Machine may modify your <CODE>CLASSPATH</CODE> environment
	variable to include the libaries they use.  Such settings can
	remain.
	</P>

	<P>
	You can change the class path by using the SDK tools'
	<A HREF="#tooloption">-classpath option</A> when you invoke 
	the JVM or other SDK tools or by using the 
	<A HREF="#env var"><CODE>CLASSPATH</CODE> environment variable</A>.
	Using the <CODE>-classpath</CODE> option is preferred
	over setting <CODE>CLASSPATH</CODE> environment variable because 
	you can set it individually for each application without 
	affecting other applications and without other applications
	modifying its value. 
	</P>

	<P>
	Classes can be stored either in directories (folders) or in
	archive files.  The Java platform classes are stored in
	<CODE>rt.jar</CODE>. For more details on archives
	and information on how the class path works, see 
	<A HREF="#Understanding">Understanding the class path and package
	names</A> near the end of this document.
	</P>

	<DL>
	<DD><B>Important Note: </B>Some older versions of the SDK software included
	a <CODE>&lt;</CODE><I>jdk-dir</I><CODE>&gt;/classes</CODE> entry 
        in the default
	class path. That directory exists for use by the SDK software, and
	should <I>not</I> be used for application classes. Application
	classes should be placed in a directory outside of the
	SDK direcotry hierarchy. That way, installing a new development 
        environment does not force you to
	reinstall application classes. For compatibility with older
	versions, applications that use the 
        <CODE>&lt;</CODE><I>jdk-dir</I><CODE>&gt;/classes</CODE> 
        directory as a class
	library will run in the current version, but there is no
	guarantee that they will run in future versions.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>
	In general, you will want to use the <CODE>-classpath</CODE> 
	command-line option, as explained in the previous
	section.  This section shows you how to set the <CODE>CLASSPATH</CODE>
	environment variable if you want to do that, or clear settings
	left over from a previous installation.
	</P>

	<H3><B>Setting CLASSPATH</B></H3>
	<P>
	In csh, the <CODE>CLASSPATH</CODE> environment variable is modified with
	the <CODE><B>setenv</B></CODE> command. The format is:
<P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <CODE><B>setenv CLASSPATH </B></CODE><I>path1</I><CODE><B>:</B></CODE><I>path2</I>
        </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
	In sh, the <CODE>CLASSPATH</CODE> environment variable can be modified with
	these commands:
	<P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<CODE><B>CLASSPATH = </B></CODE><I>path1</I><CODE><B>:</B></CODE><I>path2</I><CODE><B>:</B></CODE>...<BR>
        <CODE><B>export CLASSPATH</B></CODE>
        </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

	<H3><B>Clearing CLASSPATH</B></H3>
	<P>
	If your <CODE>CLASSPATH</CODE> environment variable has been set to a value
	that is not correct, or if your startup file or script is
	setting an incorrect path, you can unset <CODE>CLASSPATH</CODE> in csh by
	using:
	</P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<CODE><B>unsetenv CLASSPATH</B></CODE>
        </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
	In sh, you would use:
	</P>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
	<CODE><B>unset CLASSPATH</B></CODE>
        </BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>
	These commands unset <CODE>CLASSPATH</CODE> for the current shell
	only. You should also delete or modify your startup settings
	to ensure that you have the right <CODE>CLASSPATH</CODE> settings in future
	sessions.

   <H3><B>Changing Startup Settings</B></H3>
	If the <CODE>CLASSPATH</CODE> variable is set at system startup, the place

<A NAME="Understanding"></A>
<H2>Understanding the class path and package names</H2>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>
	Java classes are organized into packages which are mapped to
	directories in the file system. But, unlike the file system,
	whenever you specify a package name, you specify the
	<I>whole</I> package name -- never part of it.  For example,
	the package name for <CODE>java.awt.Button</CODE> is <I>always</I>
	specified as <CODE>java.awt</CODE>.
	</P>

	<P>
	For example, suppose you want the Java runtime to find a class
	named <CODE>Cool.class</CODE> in the package <CODE>utility.myapp</CODE>. 
        If the path to that directory
	is <CODE>/java/MyClasses/utility/myapp</CODE>, you
	would set the class path so that it contains <CODE>/java/MyClasses</CODE>.
	</P>

	<P>
	To run that app, you could use the following JVM command:
	<P>
	<CODE>% <B>java -classpath /java/MyClasses utility.myapp.Cool</B></CODE>
	<P>
	When the app runs, the JVM uses the class path settings to
	find any other classes defined in the <CODE>utility.myapp</CODE> 
	package that are used by the <CODE>Cool</CODE> class.
	</P>

	<P>
	Note that the entire package name is specified in the command. 
	It is not possible, for example, to set the class path so it
	contains <CODE>/java/MyClasses/utility</CODE>
	and use the command <CODE>java myapp.Cool</CODE>.  The class 
	would not be found.
	</P>

	<P>
	(You may be wondering what defines the package name for a
	class. The answer is that the package name is part of the
	class and cannot be modified, except by recompiling the
	class.)
	</P>

	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>
		<B>Note: </B>An interesting consequence of the package
		specification mechanism is that files which are part of the
		same package may actually exist in different directories. The
		package name will be the same for each class, but the path to
		each file may start from a different directory in the class
		path.
	</P>

	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<H3>Folders and archive files</H3>
	<P>
	When classes are stored in a directory (folder), like
	<CODE>/java/MyClasses/utility/myapp</CODE>, then the 
	class path entry points to the directory that contains the
	first element of the package name. (in this case,
	<CODE>/java/MyClasses</CODE>, since the package name
	is <CODE>utility.myapp</CODE>.)
	</P>

	<P>
	But when classes are stored in an archive file (a .zip or .jar
	file) the class path entry is the path to and including the .zip 
	or .jar file. For example, to use a class library that is in a .jar
	file, the command would look something like this:
	</P>
	<CODE>% <B>java -classpath /java/MyClasses/myclasses.jar utility.myapp.Cool</B></CODE>

	<H3>Multiple specifications</H3>
	<P>
	To find class files in the directory
	<CODE>/java/MyClasses</CODE> as well as classes
	in <CODE>/java/OtherClasses</CODE>, you would set the class path to:
	</P>
	<CODE>% <B>java -classpath /java/MyClasses:/java/OtherClasses</B> ...</CODE>
	<P>
	Note that the two paths are separated by a colon. 
	</P>
	<H3>Specification order</H3>
	<P>
	The order in which you specify multiple class path entries is
	important. The Java interpreter will look for classes in the
	directories in the order they appear in the class path variable. 
	In the example above, the Java interpreter will first look for a 
	needed class in the directory
	<CODE>/java/MyClasses</CODE>. Only if it doesn't find a
	class with the proper name in that directory will the
	interpreter look in the <CODE>/java/OtherClasses</CODE>
	directory.
