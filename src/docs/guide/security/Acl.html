<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>An Access Control List (ACL) is a data structure that guards access
to resources. The <I>java.security.acl </I>package provides the interface to
such a data structure and the <i>sun.security.acl</i> package provides
a default implementation of the interfaces specified in the <I>java.security.acl
</I>package. 

<p>Note: This API is not used internally for JDK system
security. It was introduced in JDK 1.1, and remains for backwards
compatibility. It may undergo substantial
revision and extension or even replacement in future releases.
This document describes the current interfaces.

<p>An ACL can be thought of as a data structure with multiple
ACL entries. Each ACL entry, of interface type AclEntry, contains a
set of permissions associated with a particular principal. (A
principal represents an entity such as an individual user or a
group). Additionally, each ACL entry is specified as being either
positive or negative. If positive, the permissions are to be
granted to the associated principal. If negative, the permissions
are to be denied.<p>

<p>An access control list
is independent of the authentication scheme used to verify the validity
of the principal. It is also independent of the encryption scheme used
to transmit the data across the network. The ACL is consulted after the
authentication phase. After the principal is verified to be an authenticated
user in the system, the principal might access resources. For each such
resource, the principal might or might not be granted access depending
on the permissions that are granted to the principal in the ACL that guards
the resource. The ACL itself is independent of the resource that it guards.
The ACL can be consulted to find the list of permissions a particular principal
has or to find out whether or not a principal is granted a particular permission.
</P>

<H2>ACL structure </H2>

<P>An ACL is an object that implements the <i>java.security.acl.Acl</i> interface.
Each <I>Acl </I>is a list of <I>AclEntry </I>objects. Each <I>AclEntry
</I>associates a <I>Principal</I> or a <I>Group</I> object to a list of
<I>Permission</I> objects. (Note: Group is a subclass of Principal.)
Each <I>AclEntry </I>can also be designated
as a positive entry or a negative entry. A positive entry grants the list
of permissions in the entry to the principal or group and a negative entry
denies the list of permissions to the principal or group. </P>

<H2>Calculation of granted permissions </H2>

<P>When calculating the net permissions a principal is granted, the following
rules are used. </P>

<OL>
<LI>Each principal or group can have at most one positive ACL entry and 
one negative entry; that is, multiple positive or negative ACL entries are
not allowed for any principal or group. </LI>

<LI>If there is no entry for a particular principal or a group, then 
the principal or the group has the null permission set. </LI>

<LI>The net group positive permission set for a principal is the union
of all the positive permissions of each group that the principal belongs
to. </LI>

<LI>The net group negative permission set for a principal is the union
of all the negative permissions of each group that the principal belongs
to. </LI>

<LI>If there is a positive entry that grants a principal or a group a particular
permission and a negative entry that denies the principal or group the
same permission, then that permission is removed from both the positive
permissions set and the negative permissions set. </LI>

<LI>Individual permissions (permissions granted or denied to a specific
principal) always override the Group permissions. Specifically, individual
negative permissions (specific denial of permissions) override the group's
positive permissions. And individual positive permissions override the
group's negative permissions. </LI>

<LI>Assume that the positive permission set of all the groups that the
principal belongs to is g1 and the negative permission set of all the groups
that the principal belongs to is g2. Also assume that the individual
positive permission set for the principal is p1 and the individual negative
permission set for the principal is p2. Then the resulting permissions
that the principal is granted are (p1 + (g1 - p2)) - (p2 + (g2 - p1)). </LI>
</OL>

<H2>Example permission calculations </H2>

<P>Assume that a principal P belongs to groups G1 and G2. The table below
shows 5 columns using some examples of permissions given to G1, G2 and
P. The resulting permissions granted to P are shown in the last column.
