<H1><B>Applying the Factory Pattern to RMI</B></H1></CENTER>

<p>What is a "factory" and why would you want to use one? A factory, in
this context, is a piece of software that implements one of the
"factory" design patterns introduced in the book, <A
HREF="http://www.awprofessional.com/catalog/product.asp?product_id={E1CD5BE7-E008-481B-8D0C-8E80CE9978F9}">
Design Patterns, Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software.</A> In
general, a factory implementation is useful when you need one object to
control the creation of and/or access to other objects.By using a
factory in RMI, you can reduce the number of objects that you need to
register with the RMI registry.

<H2>Examples of Factories in the Real World:</H2>

<blockquote>
<H3>The Bank</H3>

<p>When you go to the bank to make a deposit to your account, 
you <I>don't</I> walk up to a vault, pull out a drawer with your
name on it, drop in your money, shut the drawer and leave. Think about
how you originally established, or <I>opened</I>, the account. You probably
went to the bank, spoke with an Account Manager, and signed some papers.
In return, they gave you some checks, a passbook, or a bank card so 
you could access your account in the future.

<P>The Account Manager is an example of a factory. The person or
Automated Teller Machine (ATM) that acts as account manager controls
the creation of and/or access to individual accounts.  <H3> The
Library</H3> Let's think about how a book, compact disk, or video tape
gets from the library shelf into your home.  Before you can check out
any material, you must first get a library card from the librarian. In
this case, the librarian could be viewed as a <i>library card</i>
factory because the librarian controls the creation of new library card
instances.

<P>Once you have a library card, you can go into the library, and
without any further fuss, just walk out with all your materials, right?
Of course not. Before you can walk out of the library without setting
off the alarm system, you must <I>check out</I> the book, CD, or video
tape you wish to take home. So you present your library card to, you
guessed it, the librarian, who will use your card to access the library
database to see if you owe any late fees, and to register these new
materials as having been leased to you. In this case, the librarian
could be seen as a <i>book</i> factory because the librarian controls
your access to the books.

</blockquote>

<H2>How Does a Factory Work in RMI?</H2>

<p>Just like any other RMI program, there are a few basic players: a
server that produces one or more remote objects, each of which
implements a remote interface; a client that accesses a name server
(the <code>rmiregistry</code>) to get a reference to one of the remote
objects; and the <code>rmiregistry</code>, which facilitates the
client's initial contact with the server.

<P>For the picture below and the steps that follow, you may make the
following assumptions:
<UL>
	<LI>There are two remote interfaces that the client understands, 
	<code>Factory</code> and <code>Product</code>

	<LI>The <code>FactoryImpl</code> implements the <code>Factory</code> 
	interface andthe <code>ProductImpl</code> implements the 
	<code>Product</code> interface

</UL>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="images/Factory-1.gif" ALT="Illustrates the 6 actions listed below."></CENTER>

<blockquote>
<OL>
<BR>

	<LI>The <code>FactoryImpl</code> registers, or is registered,
	with the <code>rmiregistry</code>

	<LI>The client requests a reference to a <code>Factory</code>

	<LI>The <code>rmiregistry</code> returns a remote reference to
	a <code>FactoryImpl</code>

	<LI>The client invokes a remote method on the
	<code>FactoryImpl</code> to obtain a remote reference to a
	<code>ProductImpl</code>

	<LI>The <code>FactoryImpl</code> returns a remote reference to
	an existing <code>ProductImpl</code> or to one that it just
	created, based on the client request

	<LI>The client invokes a remote method on the <code>ProductImpl</code>



</OL>

<H2>How Could the Bank and Library be Implemented in RMI?</H2>

<blockquote>

<H3>The Bank</H3>

<p>In code, <code>AccountManager</code> would be a remote interface
with one or more remote methods. These methods would return objects
that implement the <code>Account</code> interface. In a similar
fashion, <code>Account</code> would be an interface that declared all
of the operations a person could perform on an account instance, such
as depositing or withdrawing money, getting an account balance, or
listing the most recent account transactions.

<P>In RMI, only the instance of the <code>AccountManager</code>
implementation would be registered with the RMI registry. The
<code>AccountManager</code> implementation would be the factory, 
returning remote references to (or serialized instances of)
<code>Account</code> implementations, like your savings account.

<H3>The Library</H3>

<p>In the library example, the <code>Librarian</code> would be a remote
interface with one or more methods that would return objects that
implement the <code>LibraryCard</code> interface. In addition, the
<code>Librarian</code> interface would have methods to allow you access
to books, CDs, or videotapes that implemented the <code>Loanable</code>
interface.

<P>In RMI, only the instance of the <code>Librarian</code>
implementation would be registered with the RMI registry. The
<code>Librarian</code> implementation would be the factory, 
returning remote references to (or serialized instances of)
<code>LibraryCard</code> implementations and <code>Loanable
</code>object implementations.
