  Used for #includes and #defines for experimental features.

  When the features become mainstream the #include files will
  move out of here and into the files which need them.  The
  #defines will then be retired.



  JKC: This file solves a problem of how to avoid forking the
  code base when working on new features e.g:
    - Additional displays in Audacity
    - Modular architecture.
  Add #defines in here for the new features, and make your code
  conditional on those #defines.

  All the #defines are positive, i.e., when defined,
  they enable the feature.

// This was a 2008 GSoC project that was making good progress at the half-way point
// but then the student didn't contribute after that.  It needs a bit of work to finish it off.
// As a minimum, if this is turned on for a release,

// preferrably disabled until other work is done.  Martyn 22/12/2008.
