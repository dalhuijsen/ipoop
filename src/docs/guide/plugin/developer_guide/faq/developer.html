<h2><b><font size=+1><a name="authors"></a></font>Information for Web Page Authors</b>&nbsp; 
</h2>
<p><b>Q: As a web page author, how do I use Java Plug-in Software?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>To utilize all of the features and capabilities of Java 2 SDK, Standard 
  Edition, web page authors must modify the page's HTML to specify the use of 
  Sun's JRE via Java Plug-in. Sun is provides a specification&#151;<a href="../using_tags.html">Using 
  <code>OBJECT</code>, <code>EMBED</code> and <code>APPLET</code> Tags in Java 
  Plug-in</a>&#151;to guide web page authors on how to make these changes. In 
  addition, Sun provides the Java Plug-in HTML Converter, free of charge; it will 
  automatically make the changes to the HTML of a selected web page or set of 
  web pages.
<p><b>Q: For Windows, the above specification mentions JRE releases that can be 
  autodownloaded via <code>.cab</code> files. Where do I find a complete list 
  of such JRE releases?</b> 
<p><b>A:</b> See <a href="../../../deployment/autodl/autodl-files.html">Autodownload 
  Files (Windows Only)</a>.
<p><b>Q: How can I get the the Java Plug-in Software HTML Converter?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>The Java Plug-in HTML Converter is bundled with the J2SE SDK. It 
  is free.
<p><b>Q: How do I run the HTML Converter?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>See <a href="../html_converter_more.html">More About the HTML Converter</a>.
<p><b>Q: What capabilities do the supplementary templates provide with the Java 
  Plug-in HTML Converter?&nbsp; </b> 
<p><b>A: </b>The HTML Converter provides both a default template (<code>default.tpl</code>) 
  and three supplementary templates. The supplementary templates allow web-page 
  authors to more explicitly target browsers and platforms in their environment 
  when modifying pages with the HTML Converter: 
<ol>
  <li><b><code>default.tpl</code>:&nbsp;</b> The default template used by the 
    Java Plug-in HTML Converter. The converted page can be used in <a href="../overview.html#supported">supported 
    versions of Internet Explorer and Navigator on supported operating systems</a> 
    to invoke the Java Plug-in.</li>
  <li><b><code>extend.tpl</code>:&nbsp;</b> The converted page can be used with 
    any supported browser or platform. Java Plug-in will be invoked on all <a href="../overview.html#supported">supported 
    operating systems and browsers</a>. If operating system or browser is not 
    supported by Java Plug-in, then the browser's default Java runtime will be 
    used.</li>
  <li><b><code>ieonly.tpl</code>:&nbsp;</b> The converted page can be used to 
    invoke Java Plug-in in <a href="../overview.html#supported">supported versions 
    of Internet Explorer on supported operating systems</a>.</li>
  <li><code><b>nsonly.tpl</b></code><b>:&nbsp;</b> The converted page can be used 
    to invoke Java Plug-in in <a href="../overview.html#supported">supported versions 
    of Navigator on supported operating systems</a>.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Q: How do I specify a JAR file as part of an <tt>OBJECT</tt> or <tt>EMBED</tt> 
  tag?&nbsp;</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>You can specify one or more JAR files by defining an <tt>archive</tt>, 
  <tt>cache_archive</tt>, or <tt>cache_archive_ex </tt> parameter in the <tt>OBJECT</tt> 
  or <tt>EMBED</tt> tag. 
<p>The <code>archive</code> parameter with the <tt>OBJECT</tt> tag this looks 
  like: 
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>&lt;PARAM NAME=&quot;archive&quot; VALUE=&quot;demo.jar,fred.jar&quot;></code> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For more information on the <code>cache_archive</code> and <code>cache_archive_ex</code> 
  parameters, see <a href="../applet_caching.html">Applet Caching</a>.</p>
<p>With the <tt>EMBED</tt> tag this looks like:
<blockquote> <code>&lt;EMBED ... archive=&quot;demo.jar,fred.jar&quot; ... &gt; 
  </code> </blockquote>
<p><b>Q: Does Java Plug-in Software support multiple JAR files in the <tt>archive</tt> 
  attribute in the <tt>APPLET</tt> tag? If so, why can't I get this to work? </b> 
<p><b>A: </b>The <tt>archive</tt> attribute is supported in both the <tt>EMBED 
  </tt>and <tt>OBJECT</tt> tags. The most common mistake is to put the JAR files 
  in the wrong order. For example, if you use the Swing set with Java Plug-in 
  and specify <tt>archive="Myjar.jar,swing.jar,..."</tt>, Java Plug-in will fail 
  to load the applet because when <tt>Myjar.jar</tt> is loaded and Java Plug-in 
  tries to initialize the applet, <tt>swing.jar</tt> is not yet loaded. The JAR 
  files in the <tt>archive</tt> should be in the order of dependency; since <tt>Myjar.jar</tt> 
  depends on other JARs, it should be put at the end of the list. The other common 
  mistake is to put spaces or paths with the JAR file lists. 
<p> 
<h2><b><font size=+1><a name="developers"></a></font>Information for Applet Developers</b>&nbsp; 
</h2>
<p><b>Q: Do developers need to modify their applets in order to support Java Plug-in?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>No. Any Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, 100% Pure Java applets should 
  run unmodified using the Java Plug-in. 
<p><b>Q: What is the applet lifecycle in Java Plug-in Software?</b>
<p><b>A: </b>When an applet is encountered on an HTML page, the applet will be 
  initialized and started. When the HTML page is closed, or the back button is 
  pushed, the applet with be stopped and destroyed immediately. 
<p> When the same HTML page is encountered again, the applet will be initialized 
  and started again. 
<p><b>Q: Does Java Plug-in Software support Drag and Drop between applets and 
  the native environment? If so, why can't I get it to work?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>Yes, Java Plug-in Software does support Drag and Drop. You must make 
  sure to grant the applet the correct socket permissions using <a href="../../../../tooldocs/windows/policytool.html">policytool</a> 
  to use this feature. Please see the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/net/SocketPermission.html">SocketPermission 
  class</a> documentation for more information. 
<p><b>Q: How can I speed up applet download time?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>There are several ways: 
<ul>
  <li>JAR files&#151;bundle your applets as JAR files. 
  <li>JAR indexing&#151;optimize the class loading process. See the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/jar/jar.html">JAR 
    File Specification</a> for details. 
  <li>Applet caching&#151;cache your applets in a permanent cache (see <a href="../applet_caching.html">Applet 
    Caching</a>).
</ul>
<p><b><a name="banner"></a>Q: How do I prevent the warning banner from covering 
  my GUI state?&nbsp; </b> 
<p><b>A: </b>You should use the <tt>getInsets()</tt> method to find the size of 
  your frame's decorative border. This includes the warning banner. For example, 
  if you create a <tt>Frame</tt> with size 100x100, you might find it has <tt>insets 
  [top=42,left=5,bottom=5,right=6]</tt> giving you a drawable area of 89x53. You 
  need to position your work within the drawable area. 
<p>If you need to create a drawable area of a particular size:
<ol>
  <li>create and show the <tt>Frame</tt>;</li>
  <li>use <tt>getInsets</tt> to find the insets' sizes;</li>
  <li>figure out the desired frame size by adding your desired size to the insets;</li>
  <li>then use <tt>frame.setSize()</tt> to set your frame to that size. </li>
</ol>
<p><b><a name="localhost"></a>Q: Why does <code>InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName()</code> 
  return <code>localhost</code>? </b> 
<p><b>A: </b> This is a deliberate security feature in the Java 2 platform. Untrusted 
  applets will not be given the real host name. Trusted applets (such as signed 
  applets) will be given the real host name. 
<p> 
<h2><b><font size=+1><a name="administrators"></a></font></b>Information for System 
  Administrators </h2>
<p><b>Q: I would like to change the Java Plug-in setting in thousands of machines 
  through system management tools. What should I do?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>Java Plug-in stores user specific settings under <code>&lt;user.home&gt;/.java/properties&lt;version&gt;</code>. 
  Therefore, if administrators would like to change the Java Plug-in settting 
  globally, they may use system managment tools to update the file in all machines. 
<p><b>Q: Does Java Plug-in Software replace Microsoft's or Netscape's Java runtime 
  with Sun's JRE?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>No. Java Plug-in Software does not replace the browser's underlying 
  virtual machine if it has one. (Netscape 6 and later versions of Internet Explorere 
  6 do not have a Java virtual machine.) Rather, Java Plug-in Software simply 
  enables web-page authors to specify that Sun's JRE be used instead of the default 
  Java runtime. 
<p><b>Q: What happens on browsers other than IE or Navigator, or on non-supported 
  platforms?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>The default conversion template provided with the Java Plug-in HTML 
  Converter is designed so that an applet will not be rendered in browsers other 
  than Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator on unsupported platforms. However, 
  the Java Plug-in HTML Converter provides additional templates allowing web-page 
  authors to specify that on non-supported platforms applets will be rendered 
  using the original <tt>&lt;APPLET></tt> tag with the browser's default Java 
  runtime. 
<p><b>Q: We are trying to deploy Java Plug-in Software within our intranet environment. 
  The chapter called <a href="../using_tags.html">Using <code>OBJECT</code>, <code>EMBED</code> 
  and <code>APPLET</code> Tags in Java Plug-in</a> and other documents say we 
  should set up an installation page within our intranet for Netscape users to 
  install Java Plug-in. What does this page do and how should we set it up?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>The purpose of this installation page is to act as an entry point 
  for Netscape users to install Java Plug-in Software. If a user encounters an 
  HTML page that requires Java Plug-in, the user will get redirected to this installation 
  page according to the <tt>pluginspage</tt> attribute in the <tt>EMBED</tt> tag. 
  At that point, the users should be able to download and install the correct 
  version of Java Plug-in Software for their platform. Thus, the installation 
  page should have links to download the Java Plug-in binary. 
<p> An simple example page would look like: 
<pre>
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;Java Plug-in Software Download Page&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;A HREF="ftp://myhost.com/public/jre14-win32.exe"&gt;
    Java Plug-in Software for Microsoft Windows&lt;/A&gt;
&lt/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;A HREF="ftp://myhost.com/public/plugin-14-solaris.bin"&gt;
        Java Plug-in Software for Solaris&lt;/A&gt;
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre>
Depending on how your webserver is configured, you may want to consider using 
CGI scripting instead of FTP for the download. Contact your webmaster for more 
information. 
<p><b>Q: Why is the experience of downloading and installing Netscape Navigator 
  different from Internet Explorer?</b> 
<p><b>A: </b>The releases of Netscape Navigator supported by Java Plug-in Software 
  do not provide mechanisms that allow for the automatic download and installation 
  of Java Plug-in, as in Internet Explorer. The first time Netscape Navigator 
  comes across a web page that is enabled for Java Plug-in (the <i>activated page</i>), 
  it redirects the user to another web page to download and install Java Plug-in 
  Software on the user's system. The user must then return to the activated page 
  to render the applet using Java Plug-in Software. From that point on, the browser 
  automatically invokes Java Plug-in whenever it encounters an activated page.
