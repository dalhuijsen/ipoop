                        Overview

Export controls on commercial encryption products are 
administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) in the 
U.S. Department of Commerce. Rules governing exports of 
encryption are found in the Export Administration Regulations 
(EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730-774  which implements the Export 
Administration Act ("EAA" 50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et seq.).

BIS requires that each entity exporting products be familiar 
with and comply with their affirmative obligations set forth in 
the Export Administration Regulations.  Please note that the 
regulations are subject to change.  We recommend that you obtain 
your own legal advice when attempting to export.  In addition 
some countries may restrict certain levels of encryption 
imported into their country. We recommend consulting legal 
counsel in the appropriate country or the applicable 
governmental agencies in the particular country.  

If you want to export your CSP, it must be reviewed and approved 
for export by the Bureau of Industry and Security.

                      Certification

I certify that I have read the above "Overview" and will comply 
with the Export Administration Regulations.  I understand that
