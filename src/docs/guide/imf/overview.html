<H2><A NAME="Introduction"></A>1. Introduction</H2>

<P>Input methods are software components that interpret user
operations such as typing keys, speaking, or writing using a pen
device to generate text input for applications. The most common input
methods are the ones that let users type text in Chinese, Japanese,
or Korean, languages that use thousands of different characters, on a
regular-sized keyboard. The text is typed in a form that can be
handled by regular-sized keyboards, for example, in a romanized form,
and then converted into the form that's really intended. Typically a
sequence of several characters needs to be typed and then converted
in one chunk, and conversion may have to be retried because there may
be several possible translations. Similarly, for hand-writing
recognition, the user may write a series of characters, convert them,
and select the correct text from several possible conversion results.
This process is called <EM>composition</EM>, and the text that the
input method is working on is called <EM>composed text</EM>. It ends
when the user confirms the final conversion result and the text is
<EM>committed</EM>.</P>

<P>During composition, the composed text logically belongs to the
input method, but still needs to be displayed to the user. Input
method frameworks cooperate with input methods to provide at least
two ways to do this: They enable modern text editing components to
display the text in the context of the document that it will
eventually belong to, albeit in a style that indicates that the text
still needs to be converted or confirmed by the input method. This is
called <EM>on-the-spot</EM> style input. And they provide a separate
window to display the text as a fall-back if a not-so-modern text
editing component can't deal with the text until it's confirmed. We
call this <EM>root-window</EM> style input.</P>

<P>The input method framework in the Java 2 platform enables the
collaboration between text editing components and input methods in
entering text. Its input method client API provides interfaces and
classes that enable text editing components to communicate with input
methods and implement a well-integrated text input user interface in
the on-the-spot and below-the-spot styles; it also provides
root-window style input as a fallback. Its service provider interface
(SPI) for input method engines provides interfaces that enable the
development of input methods in the Java programming language that
can be used with any Java runtime environment; it also supports
native input methods of the host platform.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Goals"></A>2. Goals</H2>

<H3>"Write Once, Run Anywhere in the World" for Text Components</H3>

<P>Text editing components that use the input method framework run on
any Java application environment and support any text input methods
available on that Java application environment without modifying or
recompiling the text editing component. The framework isolates text
editing components from differences in platforms and input method
engines. It provides only one programming model for interacting with
input methods. This lets developers write to a single API, and lets
users choose whatever input method they prefer. When using native
input methods, the framework maps to the platform input method APIs.
</P>

<P>Although engine independence will be important to most developers,
some high-end developers may want access to engine specific features.
The framework allows this access.</P>

<H3>"Write Once, Run Anywhere in the World" for Input Methods</H3>

<P>Input methods written in the Java programming language and using
the input method engine SPI can be installed into any Java
application environment and support any text component running in
that Java application environment. The framework isolates input
methods from differences in platforms and text editing components. It
provides only one programming model for interacting with text
components. This lets developers write to a single SPI, and lets
users choose whatever text editing component they prefer.</P>

<H3>Language Independence</H3>

<P>The input method framework is language independent in order to
satisfy the needs of fully international applications. Although input
methods are generally used for entering East Asian text, they may be
useful for other languages as well. For example, a transliteration
input method might be developed to allow Greek to be entered using
Latin characters.</P>

<P>The framework handles input methods for different languages at the
same time for truly multilingual text editing. While the choice of
native input methods may be limited by the host operating system, any
input method written in the Java programming language and using the
input method engine SPI can be used at any time. Text created by an
input method can have language attributes so that applications can
perform language sensitive operations on the text.</P>

<H3>Input Device Independence</H3>

<P>The input method framework is designed to accommodate many
possible input devices. Although keyboards are the predominant way of
entering text today, other devices are gaining importance. For some
platforms, pen-based input is the only way to enter text. Also, voice
input is becoming more and more popular. The input method engine SPI
opens the way to support these alternate devices.</P>

<H3>Multiple Service Levels</H3>

<P>Different programs have different needs for input method support.
Tight integration with input methods provides the best user
interface, but requires some additional programming. Some developers
may not find that additional work worthwhile, but their applications
still need to be able to receive East Asian text input. A few
programs, such as games, want direct low-level keyboard input without
interference from an input method. The framework lets programs choose
one of the following levels of text input support.</P>

<H4>Integrated Text Input User Interface</H4>

<P>Modern programs intended to be used with East Asian languages
usually provide a fully integrated user interface for text input
operations and show the text being composed embedded in the document
text. While converting text, the current candidate is highlighted,
and when the user chooses a different candidate, the previous
candidate text is replaced with the new one. This user interface
support for input methods is known as <EM>on-the-spot</EM> style (or
<EM>inline</EM> style). An alternative that Chinese-speaking users
often prefer is the <EM>below-the-spot</EM> style, where composed
text is shown in a separate composition window that is automatically
positioned close to the insertion point where text will be inserted
after being committed. The input method client API lets text editing
components implement these integrated text input user interfaces.
</P>

<P>Integration does not only mean displaying the composed text in the
context of the target document. It also means that the text editing
component understands "input method events", which let the input
method communicate more information about the text than simple key
events (for example, grammatical information), and that it can
responds to requests for information from the input method that let
the input method improve its functionality (for example, its
accuracy).</P>

<H4>Non-Integrated Text Input User Interface</H4>

<P>For programs that do not want to deal with the user interface for
text input operations, only final input text is sent to the
application. In this case, the framework provides a user interface
for input operations in a separate composition window outside the
application. This is known as <I>root-window</I> style. It is less
convenient because the user either has to manually position the
window near the insertion point or to move his/her eyes between the
composition window and the application window.</P>

<P>In this case, the application receives the input text as a
sequence of key events. Therefore, there is no way to receive any
information associated with the input text, such as grammatical
information. Also, surrogate pairs (as defined in the Unicode
Standard, version 2.0) are received as two separate key events.</P>

<H4>No Input Method Support</H4>

<P>Some applications, such as game software, may need only raw key
input and no input method support. The framework provides a way to
explicitly disable input method support.</P>

<H3>Building Block Reuse</H3>

<P>An important theme of object-oriented programming is reuse of
program building blocks. The same building block may be used in many
different applications, and several times within the same
application. To make it easy to combine different text editing
building blocks of possibly different capabilities, the input method
framework interacts with each text editing component directly and
individually.</P>

<P>As a consequence, many applications will not interact with the
input method framework directly at all. Instead, they will use
ready-made text editing components, such as the Swing text
components, which will handle the interaction for them.</P>

<H3>Close Integration with Other Frameworks</H3>

<P>The input method framework is designed as an integral part of the
Java platform. Interfaces that are necessary to exchange text between
input methods and text components are designed to also support
communication between other text-related frameworks, such as Java 2D
and the Swing text components. Support for input method highlight
drawing is integrated into Java 2D, so that text components can treat
composed text just like any other text and the highlights just like
any other style. Java 2D interacts with the input method framework to
determine appropriate visual styles for input method highlights
depending on the platform. The Swing text components use the input
method framework to implement the best possible user interface with
minimal additional programming.</P>

<H2><A NAME="Input Method Support in Other Frameworks"></A>3. Input
Method Support in Other Frameworks</H2>

<P>This chapter summarizes functionality in other Java platform
frameworks that support input methods.</P>

<H3>Text</H3>

<P>The
<CODE><A HREF="../../api/java/text/AttributedCharacterIterator.html">AttributedCharacterIterator</A></CODE>
interface provides a standard way of communicating text information
with attributes between frameworks. It lets text readers access text
without having to know how the text is stored in the information
provider. Attribute information may include font and style attributes
as well as language tags and grammatical annotations.</P>

<H3>Abstract Window Toolkit</H3>

<P>The
<CODE><A HREF="../../api/java/awt/Window.html">Window</A></CODE>
class creates an initial input context for the window, and disposes
this input context for the window when the window is disposed.
Explicitly disposing input contexts allows to free up the (often
substantial) resources allocated by native input methods.</P>

<P>The
<CODE><A HREF="../../api/java/awt/Component.html">Component</A></CODE>
class has methods to handle input contexts and input method request
handlers. Newly created <CODE>Component</CODE> instances other than
windows initially share the input context of their containing window.
The event handling in the <CODE>Component</CODE> class redirects
incoming events to the input context associated with the component,
and only passes them on to the component's listeners if they have not
been consumed by an input method. Focus changes are communicated to
the input context so it can activate or deactivate input methods.
</P>

<P>The AWT classes that have knowledge of event or listener classes
handle the <CODE>InputMethodEvent</CODE> and
<CODE>InputMethodListener</CODE> classes.</P>

<P>The <CODE>Graphics</CODE> class defines a
<CODE><A HREF="../../api/java/awt/Graphics.html#drawString(java.text.AttributedCharacterIterator, int, int)">drawString</A></CODE>
method that accepts <CODE>AttributedCharacterIterator</CODE>
instances as input. Instances of the
<CODE><A HREF="../../api/java/awt/font/TextLayout.html">TextLayout</A></CODE>
class can be constructed from
<CODE>AttributedCharacterIterator</CODE> instances and used to draw
text with input method highlights. Both ways of drawing text
recognize input method highlights as attributes of the text and
render them.</P>

<H3>Swing</H3>

<P>The <A HREF="../../api/javax/swing/text/JTextComponent.html">Swing
text components</A> in the Java 2 platform are by default active
clients of the input method framework. That means, applications using
these text components will use on-the-spot or below-the-spot style
input by default. Application developers are still responsible for
<A HREF="api-tutorial.html#Ending Input Operations">ending input
operations</A> when some other operation is started that requires the
text to be committed. They may also use the input method framework's
methods to
<A HREF="api-tutorial.html#Creating Private Input Contexts">create a
private input context</A>, to
<A HREF="api-tutorial.html#Selecting Input Methods">select an input
method</A>, or to
<A HREF="api-tutorial.html#Setting an Expected Character Subset">set
an expected character subset</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="FAQ"></A>4. Frequently Asked Questions</H2>

<H4>How are input methods supported in previous versions of the Java
platform?</H4>

<P>Here's the history of input method support in the Java platform:
</P>

<UL>
   <LI>1.0: no input method support.
   
   <LI>1.1: host input methods supported for peered text components
   (TextArea, TextField).
   
   <LI>1.1.6: host input methods supported for lightweight
   components, root-window style only.
   
   <LI>1.2: introduces input method client API, enabling on-the-spot
   style for lightweight components. Swing text components become
   active clients.
   
   <LI>1.3: introduces input method engine SPI, enabling input
   methods written in the Java programming language. Introduces
   below-the-spot style.
</UL>

<H4>Why is there no method that lets a client component choose an
input method by name?</H4>

<P>The input method framework lets client components select an input
method by locale, but not by name. Which input method is used to
enter text for a given language is the user's choice, and text
components should be written to work with any input method. If text
components want to take advantage of enhanced features of specific
input methods, they can call getInputMethodControlObject and, if the
result is an instance of a class they know about, call its methods.
</P>

<H4>How can I obtain a IIIMP adapter?</H4>

<P>Version 1.2 of the Java 2 Runtime Environment included a client
side adapter for the Internet-Intranet Input Method Protocol (IIIMP),
a Sun Microsystems technology which enables the use of server-based
input methods over the network. This adapter was included to allow
the evaluation of this protocol at a time when there was no public
interface that would let users install the adapter into a Java
runtime environment as a separate software component. Version 1.3 of
the Java 2 platform provides a public input method engine SPI, so
that the adapter, like other input systems, can now be developed and
distributed as a separate product and installed into any
implementation of the Java 2 platform. A version of the IIIMP adapter
that uses the SPI is currently being developed by Sun Microsystems.
To obtain current information, go to the
<A HREF="http://soldc.sun.com">Solaris Developer Connection</A> and
search for "IIIM".</P>
