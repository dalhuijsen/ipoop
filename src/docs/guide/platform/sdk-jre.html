      <h1>Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> 2 SDK and Java Runtime Environment</h1>
</center>



<h2>Overview</h2>
There are two principal products in the Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> 2 Platform, Standard Edition, 
(J2SE<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup>) platform family.
<p>
<dl>
<dt>Java Runtime Environment (RE)
<dd>The Java RE provides the 
libraries, Java virtual machine, and other components necessary 
for you to <em>run</em> applets and applications written in the Java 
programming language.  It does not contain 
tools and utilities such as compilers or debuggers for developing 
applets and applications.
<p>
<dt>Java 2 Software Development Kit (SDK)
<dd>The Java 2 SDK is a superset of the Java RE. 
The Java 2 SDK contains everything that's in the Java RE, 
plus additional tools such as compilers and debuggers that are 
necessary for <em>developing</em> applets and applications.
</dl>
<p>
Question: Why would anyone want the Java RE if the 
Java 2 SDK has everything in the Java RE and more? 

<p>Answer: The Java RE is smaller and therefore easier to 
download or distribute with software than the Java 2 SDK.  Most users 
of Java technology are people 
who just want to run applets and applications developed by others.  
They're not interested in developing any applications themselves.  
The relatively small Java RE is made for such 
end users.  They can download the Java RE themselves 
from the web, or software vendors can include it in their own 
products.  The typical end-user doesn't need the bulkier Java 2 SDK 
with its development tools.
