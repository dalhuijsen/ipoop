<h2>Properties that are useful to set on JVMs<sup><font
size=-2>*</font></sup> that export remote objects</h2>

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><b><code>java.rmi.activation.port</b></code> (1.2 and later)</dt>
	<dd> This property is used to set the TCP port number on which
	this VM should communicate with <code>rmid</code> (by default,
	<code>rmid</code> listens on port 1098, but can be set to
	listen on a different port by using the <code>-port</code>
	option on the <code>rmid</code> command line). The default
	value of this property is 1098, so this property only needs to
	be set on VMs that need to communicate with an instance of
	<code>rmid</code> that is running on a port other than 1098.
</dd>

<p>
<dt><b><code>java.rmi.dgc.leaseValue</b></code> (1.1 and later)</dt> 
	<dd> The value of this property represents the lease duration
	(in milliseconds) granted to other JVMs that hold remote
	references to objects which have been exported by this JVM.
	Clients usually renew a lease when it is 50% expired, so a very
	short value will increase network traffic and risk late
	renewals in exchange for reduced latency in calls to
	<code>Unreferenced.unreferenced</code>.  The default value of
	this property is 600000 milliseconds (10 minutes).</dd>
<p>
<dt><b><code>java.rmi.server.codebase</b></code> (1.1 and later)</dt>
	<dd> This property specifies the locations from which classes
	that are published by this JVM (for example: stub classes,
	custom classes that implement the declared return type of a
	remote method call, or interfaces used by a proxy or stub
	class) may be downloaded. The value of this property is a
	string in URL format (or a space-separated list of URLs in 1.2
	and later) that will be the codebase annotation for all classes
	loaded from the CLASSPATH of (and subsequently marshalled by)
	this JVM. </dd>

	<p><b>Note:</b>This property must be set correctly in order to
	dynamically download classes and interfaces using RMI. If this
	property is not set correctly, you will likely encounter
	exceptions when attempting to run your server or client. For
	more information on this property, see <i><a
	href="codebase.html">Dynamic code downloading using RMI (Using
	the <code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code> Property)</i></a>.

<p>
<dt><b><code>java.rmi.server.hostname</b></code> (1.1 and later)</dt> 	
	<dd> The value of this property represents the host name string
	that should be associated with remote stubs for locally created
	remote objects, in order to allow clients to invoke methods on
	the remote object.  In 1.1.7 and later, the default value of
	this property is the IP address of the local host, in
	"dotted-quad" format.</dd>
<p>
<dt><b><code>java.rmi.server.logCalls</b></code> (1.1 and later)</dt>	
	<dd>  If this value is <code>true</code>, incoming calls and
	exceptions thrown from incoming calls will be logged to
	<code>System.err</code>. Setting this property to
	<code>true</code> will greatly assist you in debugging your
	RMI programs. See also <i><a
href="sunrmiproperties.html/#et"><code>sun.rmi.server.exceptionTrace</a></i></code>.</dd>
<p>
<dt><b><code>java.rmi.server.randomIDs</b></code> (1.1.8 and later)</dt>
	<dd>  If this value is <code>true</code>, object identifiers
	for remote objects exported by this JVM will be generated by
	using a cryptographically secure random number generator.  The
	default value is <code>false</code>.</dd>
<p>
<dt><b><code>java.rmi.server.useCodebaseOnly</b></code> (1.1 and later)</dt>
	<dd> If this value is <code>true</code>, automatic loading of
	classes is prohibited <i>except</i> from the local CLASSPATH
	and from the <code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code> property set
	on this JVM.  Use of this property prevents client JVMs from
	dynamically downloading bytecodes from other codebases. This
	property is ignored in the implementations of 1.2 and 1.2.1 because
	of a bug.</dd>
<p>
<dt><b><code>java.rmi.server.useLocalHostname</b></code> (1.1.7 and
later)</dt>
	<dd> RMI now uses an IP address to identify the local host when
	the <code>java.rmi.server.hostname</code> property is not
	specified and a fully qualified domain name for the localhost
	cannot be obtained. In order to force RMI to use the fully
	qualified domain name by default, you need to set the this
	property to <code>true</code>.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Properties that are useful to set on JVMs that make remote method
calls</h2>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><b><code>java.rmi.server.codebase</b></code> (1.1 and later)</dt>
	<dd> This property specifies the locations from which classes
	that are published by this JVM (for example, custom classes
	that implement an interface that is the declared parameter type
	of a remote method call) may be downloaded. The value of this
	property is a string in URL format (or a space-separated list
	of URLs in 1.2 and later) that will be the codebase annotation
	for all classes loaded from the CLASSPATH of (and subsequently
	marshalled by) this JVM.</dd>
	
	<p><b>Note:</b> Classes that exist in both the server's
	codebase and the client's CLASSPATH will be loaded from the
	client's CLASSPATH, rather than from the server's codebase as
	intended. For more information on this property, see <i><a
	href="codebase.html">Dynamic code downloading using RMI (Using
	the <code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code> Property)</i></a>.
<p>
<a name="disableHttp"></a>
<dt><b><code>java.rmi.server.disableHttp</b></code> (1.1 and later)</dt> 
	<dd> If this value is <code>true</code>, HTTP tunneling is
	disabled, even when <code>http.proxyHost</code> is set. The
	default value is <code>false</code>. If you know that your
	program will never need to use HTTP tunneling, then by
	disabling HTTP tunneling, you should see shorter timeouts for
	failed connections. </dd>
<p>
<dt><b><code>java.rmi.server.useCodebaseOnly</b></code> (1.1 and later)</dt>
	<dd> If this value is <code>true</code>, automatic loading of
	classes is prohibited <i>except</i> from the local CLASSPATH
	and from the <code>java.rmi.server.codebase</code> property set
	on this JVM.  Use of this property prevents client JVMs from
	dynamically downloading bytecodes from other codebases. This
	property is ignored in the implementations of 1.2 and 1.2.1
	because of a bug.</dd>
