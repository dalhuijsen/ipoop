<h3>What "Deprecated" means</h3>
<blockquote>
You may have heard the term, "self-deprecating humor". That is humor
that minimizes your importance. A deprecated class or method is like
that. It is no longer important. It is <em>so</em> unimportant, in fact,
that it should no longer be used at all, as it will probably cease to exist in the future.
<p>
The need for deprecation comes about because, as a class evolves, its API changes. 
Methods are renamed for consistency. New and better methods are added. 
Attributes change. But making such changes introduces a problem. 
You need to keep the old API around until people make the transition to the new one, 
but you don't want developers to continue programming to the old API. 
<p>
The ability to mark a class or method as "deprecated" solves the problem. 
Existing classes that use the old API continue to work, but the compiler can issue 
a warning when it finds references to deprecated items. Meanwhile, the API comments 
can warn the user against using the deprecated item and tell the user how to avoid doing so.
The <code>@deprecated</code> tag achieves these goals.
<blockquote>
<b>Note: </b>"Deprecated" and "depreciated" are not same. "Depreciated" is a financial term 
that means "lowered value". Although the meanings are similar, classes and methods are 
deprecated, not depreciated.
</blockquote>

<h3>When to Deprecate</h3>
<blockquote>
Designers of new APIs should carefully consider whether they are
superseding old APIs.  For each such API, if they wish to encourage
users of the old previous API to migrate to the new API, they should
add a deprecation paragraph to the documentation comment.  Empty
deprecation paragraphs are bad form, because they do not help the
user fix the warnings that arise from the deprecation.
<p>
Valid reasons for wishing one's users to migrate to the new API include:
 - the old API is insecure, buggy, or highly inefficient
 - the old API is going away in a future release
 - the old API encourages very bad coding practices

Not all of these reasons are of equal weight, yet deprecation is a
reasonable (though not mandatory) choice in all these cases.  Therefore,
the use of deprecated APIs can never be made a hard error by default.
Also, the deprecation comments need to help the user decide when to
move to the new API, and so should briefly mention the technical reasons
for deprecation.
</blockquote>

<h3>What happens when an API is Deprecated</h3>
<blockquote>
In parallel with the access-checking logic for classes and
members, the compiler looks for deprecated attributes of classes and
members being accessed, and issues warnings when the deprecated classes
or members are used.
<blockquote>
<b>Note: </b>A deprecation warning is suppressed if the compilation unit containing
the deprecation is being compiled at the same time as the compilation
unit using the deprecated class or member. This allows legacy APIs to
be built without warnings. There currently is no other way to suppress
the deprecation warnings.
</blockquote>
JavaDoc also pays special attention to @deprecated tags when generating html files.
Javadoc parses the entire paragraph following the @deprecated tag and moves 
it to the front of the description, placing it in italics and preceding 
it with a warning, "Note: foo is deprecated", in bold.  It also adds 
"Deprecated" in bold to any index entries mentioning the deprecated entity.
</blockquote>

<a name="how"></a>
<h3>How to Deprecate</h3>
<blockquote>
To deprecate a class or method, use the <code>@deprecated</code> tag,
as explained in <a href="/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/index.html">How to Write Doc Comments for JavaDoc</a>.
The paragraph following the <code>@deprecated</code> tag should explain why the item
has been deprecated and suggest how the user can avoid using it.
<p>
It is not necessary to deprecate individual members of a deprecated
class, unless of course the programmer wants to explain some specific
point about one member.
<blockquote>
  <b>Note: </b>Deprecation applies to classes and to individual members, not
  to their names.  It is possible for a single method to have deprecated
  and non-deprecated overloadings.  It is possible for a non-deprecated
  member to hide or override a deprecated one, which removes deprecation.
  It is the responsibility of the programmer to deprecate overrides of
  a deprecated method, if in fact they should be deprecated.
</blockquote>
It is probably <em>not</em> good to specifically mention a timetable for
phase-out of the deprecated API; this is a business decision that needs
to be communicated other ways.
<p>
When a feature is deprecated, it is a good idea to notify the
engineering organization of this fact, so that other engineers can
respond to the change (pro or con) in a timely manner.
