<h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
For enterprise customers it is important to be able to set up secure computing 
environments within their companies, and proxy configuration is an essential part 
of doing that. Proxy configuration acts as a security barrier; it ensures that 
the proxy server monitors all traffic between the Internet and the intranet. This 
is normally an integral part of security enforcement in corporate firewalls within 
intranets. Enterprise customers who want to use Java Plug-in to deploy applets 
on their intranet web pages may also set up proxy support. This support is required 
for Java Plug-in to work in an intranet environment and can be set up through 
the Java Plug-in Control Panel. 
<p>The Control Panel provides three <a href="control_panel.html#proxies">proxy 
  options</a>: 
<ul>
  <li>&quot;Use browser settings&quot;</li>
  <li>Manual configuration through the Protocol-Address-Port table</li>
  <li>&quot;Automatic proxy configuration URL&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>If &quot;Use browser settings&quot; is selected, then proxy information is 
  entered entirely through the browser. For Internet Explorer, go to Tools&gt;Internet 
  Options ... and select the Connections tab and then LAN Settings ... ; for Netscape, 
  go to Edit&gt;Preferences ... and select Advanced under Category and then Proxies. 
  How this works and the three types of connections that can be set up through 
  the browser&#151;Direct, Manual, and Automatic&#151;are described in the following 
  sections. 
<p>If you select manual configuration in the Control Panel, then you must enter 
  in the table for each protocol the address and port for the proxy server. Note 
  that you may select to exclude some hosts from requiring proxy servers by listing 
  them in the field labeled &quot;No proxy host&quot;. 
<p>If you select &quot;Automatic proxy configuration URL&quot;, then you must 
  enter the URL for the location of the JavaScript called <code>FindProxyForURL(URL 
  url)</code> that returns the proxy server to be used for a URL. Support for 
  this script is the same as described below under <a href="#automatic">Automatic 
  Proxy Configuration</a>. 
<p>
<h2> <a name="how"></a>How Java Plug-in Obtains Proxy Information From the Browser</h2>
Because browsers on different platforms store proxy information differently, there 
is no generic mechanism to obtain proxy information. Here's how Java Plug-in obtains 
proxy information for three different browser-platform combinations: 
<p><b>Internet Explorer on Win32: </b>IE stores proxy information in the same 
  set of keys in the windows registry. Java Plug-in obtains this information directly. 
</p>
<p><b>Netscape Navigator on Win32: </b>Navigator 4 stores proxy information in 
  the user preference file on the local machine. Java Plug-in reads and parses 
  the user preference file to obtain the Navigator 4 proxy information. Netscape 
  6 has an API for obtaining proxy information. <code>findProxyForURL(URL)</code> 
  returns proxy configuration information for the <code>URL</code> passed to it.
<p><b>Netscape Navigator on Solaris and Linux: </b>Navigator stores proxy information 
  in a file in the local machine. Java Plug-in reads and parses this file to obtain 
  the proxy information. For Netscape 6 the process is the same as described in 
  the previous section. 
<p>Java Plug-in obtains proxy information at startup time. If you change the proxy 
  setting after Java Plug-in has started, you may force Java Plug-in to reload 
  the proxy information from the browser through the <i><a href="console.html#debugging">p</a></i><a href="console.html#debugging"> 
  option in the Java Console</a>. 
<p>
<h2> <a name="direct"></a>Direct Connection</h2>
<p>Direct connection does not use a proxy. For certain situations, such as when 
  mobile users connect to the company through a modem, direct connection to the 
  intranet environment is required, and proxies should not be used in these cases. 
</p>
<h2> <a name="manual"></a>Manual Proxy Configuration</h2>
Both Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator support manual proxy configuration. 
Users can specify the proxy server and port for each protocol. Users can also 
specify one proxy server and port for all protocols. To minimize the workload 
of the proxy server, some sites might bypass the proxy server completely when 
a machine is connecting to another machine inside the intranet environment. To 
do this, network administrators and users can specify the proxy server bypass 
list in the browser's setting.&nbsp; 
<p><b>Internet Explorer: </b>Java Plug-in recognizes and supports the proxy server 
  and port setting associated with the protocol. IE supports various syntaxes 
  in the proxy server bypass list, as follows:&nbsp; 
<ul>
  <li>IP address/hostname only</li>
  <li>IP address/hostname with wildcard</li>
  <li>IP address/hostname with protocol</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if you specify <tt>"121.141.23.5;*.eng;http://*.com"</tt> in the 
  proxy server bypass list, then the browser bypasses the proxy whenever one of 
  the following occurs:&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>"121.141.23.5"</tt> is requested</li>
  <li>the URL hostname ends with <tt>".eng"</tt></li>
  <li>the URL protocol is <tt>http</tt> and the URL hostname ends with <tt>".com"</tt></li>
</ul>
<p>Currently Java Plug-in supports the first two syntaxes in the proxy server 
  bypass list in IE. IE also supports bypassing the proxy server for local (intranet) 
  addresses without using the proxy server bypass list. Java Plug-in supports 
  this option by bypassing the proxy server if the URL hostname is plain; i.e., 
  the hostname contains no dot (.).&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Netscape Navigator:</b> Java Plug-in recognizes and supports the proxy server 
  and port setting associated with the protocol. For example, if you specify <tt>".eng,.sun.com"</tt> 
  in the proxy server bypass list in Navigator, it bypasses the proxy whenever 
  the URL hostname ends with <tt>".eng"</tt> or <tt>".sun.com"</tt>. Java Plug-in 
  fully supports this syntax in the proxy server bypass list in Navigator.

<h2> <a name="automatic"></a>Automatic Proxy Configuration</h2>
Automatic proxy configuration is supported in the browser by setting a particular 
URL that contains a JavaScript file with <tt>.pac</tt> or <tt>.js</tt> extension. 
This file contains a function called <tt>FindProxyForURL</tt> that contains the 
logic to determine which proxy server to use when the browser receives a connection 
request. This function is written by the system administrator for the particular 
intranet environment. When the browser starts up, it recognizes the URL of the 
JavaScript file and downloads the file to the local machine using direct connection. 
Then whenever it needs to make a new connection, the browser executes the JavaScript 
function <tt>FindProxyForURL</tt> in the file to obtain the proxy information 
to set up the connection.&nbsp;
<p><b>Internet Explorer: </b>During startup, Java Plug-in downloads the JavaScript 
  file to the local machine using direct connection. Then whenever it needs to 
  make a new connection, it executes the <tt>FindProxyForURL</tt> function to 
  obtain the proxy information using the JavaScript engine in IE. 
<p><b>Netscape Navigator: </b>During startup, Java Plug-in downloads the JavaScript 
  file to the local machine using direct connection. Then whenever it needs to 
  make a new connection, it executes the <tt>FindProxyForURL</tt> function to 
  obtain the proxy information by using the JavaScript engine in Navigator. 
<p>There are a number of JavaScript <i>helper</i> functions which can be called 
  from the JavaScript function <tt>FindProxyForURL</tt>. Java Plug-in provides 
  its own implementation of these functions to completely emulate the automatic 
  proxy configuration. Regarding the implementation of these helper function, 
  note the following: 
<ul>
  <li>Function <tt>dnsResolve</tt> always returns an empty string if the host 
    is not an IP address</li>
  <li>Function <tt>isResolvable</tt> always returns false if the host is not an 
    IP address.</li>
  <li>Function <tt>isInNet</tt> always returns false if the host is not an IP 
    address.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that executing the function <tt>FindProxyForURL</tt> always returns proxy 
  information as a string. Java Plug-in extracts the setting in the following 
  way : </p>
<ul>
  <li>If &quot;<code>DIRECT</code>&quot; is in the string, Java Plug-in assumes 
    direct connection.</li>
  <li>If &quot;<code>PROXY</code>&quot; is in the string, it uses the first proxy 
    setting for the connection.</li>
  <li>If &quot;<code>SOCKS</code>&quot; is in the string, it uses the SOCKS v4 
    for the connection.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, the proxy information in the string is incorrect. In this cases, 
    Java Plug-in assumes direct connection.</li>
</ul>
