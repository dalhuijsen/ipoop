<h2>AWT and Swing</h2>
The Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> platform's Abstract 
Windowing Toolkit (AWT) provides APIs 
for constructing user interface components such as menus, buttons, text 
fields, dialog boxes, checkboxes, and for handling user input through 
those components.  In addition, AWT allows for rendering of 
simple shapes such as ovals and polygons and enables developers to control 
the user-interface layout and fonts used by their applications.
<p>
The Swing APIs also provide graphical component (GUI) for use in user 
interfaces.  The Swing APIs are written in the Java programming 
language without any reliance on code that is specific to the 
GUI facilities provided by underlying operating system.  This allows 
the Swing GUI components to have a "pluggable" look-and-feel that 
can be switched while an application is running.
<p>
For more information, see the J2SE <a href="../swing/index.html">Swing 
documentation</a> and <a href="../awt/index.html">AWT 
documentation</a>.


<h2>Java 2D<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> Technology</h2>
The Java 2D<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> API is a set of classes 
for advanced 2D graphics and imaging. It encompasses line art, text, 
and images in a single comprehensive model. The API provides extensive 
support for image compositing and alpha channel images, a set of
classes to provide accurate color space definition and conversion, and 
a rich set of display-oriented imaging operators.  
<p>
For more information, see the <a href="../2d/index.html">Java 2D 
documentation</a>.

<h2>Java Sound</h2>
The Java platform includes a powerful API for capturing, processing, 
and playing back audio and MIDI (Musical Intstrument Digital Interface) 
data. This API is supported by an efficient sound engine which guarantees 
high-quality audio mixing and MIDI synthesis capabilities for the platform. 
<p>
For more information, see <a href="../sound/index.html">Java Sound 
documentation</a>.


<h2>Input Method Framework</h2>
The input method framework enables the collaboration between text editing 
components and input methods in entering text.  Input methods are software 
components that let the user enter text in ways other than simple typing 
on a keyboard. They are commonly used to enter Japanese, Chinese, or 
Korean -- languages using thousands of different characters - on
keyboards with far fewer keys. However, the framework also supports input 
methods for other languages and the use of entirely different input 
mechanisms, such as handwriting or speech recognition.
<p>
For more information, see the <a href="../imf/index.html">Input 
Method Framework</a> documentation.



<h2>Accessibility</h2>
With the Java Accessibility API, developers can easily create Java 
applications that are accessible to disabled persons.  Accessible Java 
applications are compatible with assistive technologies such as screen 
readers, speech recognition systems, and refreshable braille displays. 
<p>
For more information, see the 
<a href="../access/index.html">Accessibility documentation</a>.
