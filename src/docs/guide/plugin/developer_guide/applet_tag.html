<h2><a name="applet">Support for the <tt>APPLET</tt> Tag</a></h2>
<p> Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> Plug-in now supports the HTML <tt>APPLET</tt> 
  tag for launching applets. Users may configure their browsers so that Sun's 
  JRE is the default runtime environment for handling <tt>APPLET</tt> tags. </p>

      <h2><u>Notes</u></h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Even though Java Plug-in now supports the <tt>APPLET</tt> tag, it 
          does not support applets that make use of proprietary technologies. 
          Examples of such technologies are: 
          <ul>
            <li>CAB files </li>
            <li>Authenticode signing </li>
            <li>Java Moniker</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>With the conventional applet format, use of an attribute named <code>object</code> 
          with a <code>PARAM</code> element will cause an exception with the Sun 
          VM: 'Either "code" or "object" should be specified, but not both.'. 
          With the Microsoft VM, no exception will be thrown. This is a compatibility 
          issue. To avoid the exception with the Sun VM, do not use an attribute 
          named <code>object</code> with a <code>PARAM</code> element in an applet.</li>

<h2><a name="object">Compatibility with the <tt>OBJECT</tt> Tag</a> (Internet 
  Explorer on Windows Platform)</h2>
<p> This release of Java Plug-in supports the use of <tt>APPLET</tt> tags for 
  launching applets. However, it is also fully backward compatible with previous 
  Java Plug-in releases in its support of the <tt>OBJECT</tt> tag for launching 
  applets in Internet Explorer running on the Windows platform. As before, developers 
  have the option of using the HTML Converter to set up their applet web pages 
  to use the <tt>OBJECT</tt> tag. </p>
<p> For more information about using <tt>OBJECT</tt> tags to launch applets on 
  Java Plug-in, see <a href="using_tags.html">Using OBJECT, EMBED and APPLET Tags 
  in Java Plug-in</a> and <a href="html_converter.html">Using the HTML Converter 
  to Convert Applet Tags for Java Plug-in</a>. </p>
<h2><a name="browsers">Supported Platforms and Browsers</a></h2>
The support for the <tt>APPLET</tt> tag in Java Plug-in is intended for use on 
the following operating systems: 
<ul>
  <li>Windows 95 
  <li>Windows 98 (1st and 2nd editions) 
  <li>Windows ME 
  <li>Windows NT 4.0 
  <li>Windows 2000 
  <li>Windows XP
  <li>Unix
  <li>Linux 
</ul>
<p> Java Plug-in provides support for the <tt>APPLET</tt> tag on the following 
  web browsers: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Internet Explorer 4.0 (4.01 recommended), 5.0 (5.01 recommended), 5.5 (Service 
    Pack 2 recommended), 6.0 </li>
  <li>Netscape 6.0, 6.1</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="update">Updating Old Class Files</a></h2>
<h2></h2>
<p> In some cases, the new Java Runtime Environment associated with this Java 
  Plug-in release will not run class files that were generated with old compilers. 
  The usual symptom is a <tt>java.lang.ClassFormatError</tt> that the virtual 
  machine throws when it attempts to load such a class file. This failure has 
  nothing specifically to do with the changes in this release. Rather, old bytecode 
  compilers did not strictly adhere to proper class-file format in all situations 
  when generating class files. Recent virtual machines are implemented to be strict 
  in enforcing proper class file format, and this can lead to errors when they 
  attempt to load old, improperly formatted class files. Some typical problems 
  in some older class files are (this list is not exhaustive): </p>
<ul>
  <li>There are extra bytes at the end of the class file; </li>
  <li>The class file contains method or field names that do not begin with a letter; 
  </li>
  <li>The class attempts to access private members of another class; </li>
  <li>The class file has other format errors, including illegal constant pool 
    indices and illegal UTF-8 strings; </li>
  <li>Some early (third-party) bytecode obfuscators produced class files that 
    violated proper class-file format. </li>
</ul>
<p> You can avoid this type of problem by recompiling your classes with the Javac 
  bytecode compiler from the current Java 2 SDK. If you choose to use a third-party 
  obfuscator, be sure to use one that produces class files that respect proper 
  class-file format. </p>
<h2><a name="enhancements">Other Enhancements</a></h2>
<h2></h2>
<p>In addition to the support for the <tt>APPLET</tt> tag described <a href="#applet">above</a>, 
  the Java Plug-in has many performance and architecture enhancements that will 
  make it more suitable for widespread use on consumer client machines that typically 
  are not as powerful as client platforms in an enterprise environment. Some of 
  these enhancements are summarized below. </p>
<h3>Memory management<br>
</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Dynamic maximum heap size is scaled down from 128 MB to 96MB to avoid unnecessary 
    paging on the system.</li>
  <li> Classloader implementation has been tuned to allow memory to be reclaimed 
    more often by the garbage collector.</li>
  <li> Potential memory leak issue is addressed by using JNI/COM smart pointers 
    in implementation.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3> Performance<br>
</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Applet download time is significant reduced by relying on browser caching 
    when possible. No connection will be opened on the server side unless it is 
    absolutely necessary.</li>
  <li> Applet lifecycle is controlled asynchronously to allow very fast page switch.</li>
  <li> Sped up classloader object reclaim by removing its <tt>finalize()</tt> 
    method.</li>
  <li> HTTPS read has been made significantly faster by increasing buffer size.</li>
  <li> HTTPS calls are significant faster by statically linking Microsoft's Wininet 
    instead of dynamic function lookup every time.</li>
  <li> JavaScript performance is greatly enhanced by eliminating <i>BeanInfo</i> 
    lookup over the network.</li>
  <li> Java Console performance is enhanced by using the Console Writer thread 
    to avoid blocking <tt>System.out</tt> and <tt>System.err</tt> when possible.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3> Design<br>
</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Default JavaScript/Java interaction is changed from <i>"not-scriptable"</i> 
    to <i>"scriptable"</i>, allowing any applets running through the <tt>APPLET</tt> 
    tag to be used from JavaScript without modification.</li>
</ul>
<h3> JDK 1.1 compatibility<br>
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Java Plug-in can now access the <tt>sun.audio</tt> package.</li>
  <li>Some applets are compiled with compilers that don't generate proper class 
    file format which conforms to the class-file specification. Such appletss 
    may result in a <tt>ClassFormatError</tt> when Java Plug-in attempts to load 
    them. To help address this problem, <tt>PluginClassLoader</tt> provides a 
    bytecode scanner to transform bad class files to conforming on-the-fly to 
    allow the applets to run. Currently, only bad class files with the following 
    errors may be transformed 
    <ul>
      <li>Local variable name has bad constant pool index</li>
      <li>Extra bytes at the end of the class file</li>
      <li>Code segment has wrong length</li>
      <li>Illegal Field/Method name</li>
      <li>Illegal field/method modifiers</li>
      <li>Invalid start_pc/length in local var table<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
