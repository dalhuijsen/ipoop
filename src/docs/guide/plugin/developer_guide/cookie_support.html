<h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>Cookies are a way of storing data on the client side. They have been used extensively 
  for personalization of portal sites, user preference tracking, and logging into 
  web sites. For enterprise customers using cookies in their web sites, cookie 
  support in Java<font size="-2"></font> Plug-in facilitates deployment of client-side 
  Java.</p>
<p>Cookie support allows a Java component to pass a cookie back to a web server 
  if that cookie originated from the web server. This provides the server with 
  information about the state of the client. Java Plug-in provides bidirectional 
  cookie support. <br>
</p>
<h2><a name="How"></a>How Java Plug-in Supports Cookies </h2>
<p>Java Plug-in provides cookie support through the browser API. Because browsers 
  on different platforms implement the browser's API differently, cookie support 
  in Java Plug-in varies according to platform. </p>
<p>When a browser makes an HTTP/HTTPS request through a URL connection, it normally 
  checks the cookie cache and policy to determine if a cookie should be sent along 
  with the HTTP/HTTPS request header. If so, the browser will read the cookie 
  from the cache and append the cookie as part of the HTTP/HTTPS request header.</p>
<p>When a browser processes the HTTP/HTTPS respond header through a URL connection, 
  it will check the header to see if any cookies should be set. The browser also 
  checks the cookie policy to determine if the action is allowed. If so, it will 
  extract the cookie from the HTTP/HTTPS respond header and write it into the 
  cookie cache.</p>
<p>When an HTTP/HTTPS request is made using Java Plug-in, Java Plug-in consults 
  the browser to determine if a cookie should be sent along. If so, the HTTP/HTTPS 
  request will contain the cookie as part of the header. Otherwise, the HTTP/HTTPS 
  request will be sent with no cookie attached.</p>
<p>When a cookie needs to be set from the HTTP/HTTPS respond header, Java Plug-in 
  uses the browser API to do so.</p>
<p>Cookie support in Java Plug-in is triggered transparently when an HTTP/HTTPS 
  connection needs to be made. </p>
<h3>Netscape 4 Limitation</h3>
<p>When using Java Plug-in with Netscape 4, cookie support works only if the <code>codebase</code> 
  is the same or a subdirectory of the document base. See examples in the table 
  below:</p>
<table summary="Codebase examples" width="90%" border="2" cellpadding="5" align="center">
  <tr bgcolor="#CCCCCC"> 
    <th> 
      <div align="center"><font size="4"><b>Document Base</b></font></div>
    </th>
    <th> 
      <div align="center"><font size="4"><b>Codebase</b></font></div>
    </th>
    <th> 
      <div align="center"><b><font size="4">Will It Work?</font></b></div>
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><code>http://host.com/my/</code></td>
    <td><code>http://host.com/my/</code></td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><code>http://host.com/my/</code></td>
    <td><code>http://host.com/my/pag</code>e</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><code>http://host.com/my/page/</code></td>
    <td><code>http://host.com/my/</code></td>
    <td>No</td>
  </tr>

<p>To ensure that cookie support in Java Plug-in always works as expected, the 
  following is recommended:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use Internet Explorer or Netscape 6</li>
  <li>If you must use Netscape 4, avoid having your web server set cookies in 
    an HTTP/HTTPS connection with an applet. </li>
</ul>
<p>The above recommendations apply to an intranet environment, where deployment 
  of browsers and web servers is controllable.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="Protocol"></a>Cookie Policy Support in Java Plug-in</h2>
<p>Java Plug-in supports all cookie policies that are supported in both Internet 
  Explorer and Netscape Navigator. Cookie policy can be configured in both browsers 
  (see your browser guide for details). There are various options, including the 
  following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Always accept cookies</li>
  <li>Disable all cookie use</li>
  <li>Prompt/Warn before accepting a cookie</li>
  <li>Only accept cookies from a server if they get sent back to that server</li>
</ul>
<p>When cookie policy is changed in the browser, it will take effect the next 
  time an HTTP/HTTPS connection is made via Java Plug-in. </p>
<p>Java Plug-in does not provide cookie-caching support. Instead, it consults 
  the browser every time an HTTP/HTTPS connection is made. Any change to a cookie 
  in the browser is reflected immediately in Java Plug-in when a new HTTP/HTTPS 
  connection is made.<br>
